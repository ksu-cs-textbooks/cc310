<p>Hello and welcome to the Computational Core program!</p>
<p>My name is Russ Feldhausen, and I’ll be one of the instructors for this program. My contact information is shown here, and is also listed on the syllabus</p>
<p>[Slide 2]</p>
<p>There are many other instructors and TAs for this program that you may interact with or see in the tutorial videos. They all have been instrumental in the development of this program. Specifically, I&rsquo;d like to recognize the work of Nathan Bean, the developer of the CIS 400 course on which this course is based.</p>
<p>[Slide 3]</p>
<p>In this course we will primarily use a KSU email group (cc410-help or <a href="mailto:cc410-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com" rel="external" target="_blank">cc410-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com</a>) to communicate. Email sent to this address is forwarded to all instructors and TAs.  Our replies to you will also be shared amongst the instructors and TAs so we all have access to the assistance you have already received. We will respond to you within a business day, so be aware that a question emailed Friday night may not receive an answer before Monday. Please read and adhere to the guidance on Netiquette in the syllabus for all electronic communications.</p>
<p>[Slide 3]</p>
<p>In addition to email and Canvas, we’ll be using the online learning platform Codio for most of the programming tutorials and projects in this program. We’ll also discuss how to use Codio later in this module.</p>
<p>[Slide 5]</p>
<p>The Computational Core program consists of several courses, and each course contains a number of learning modules. In general, there are about 12-15 modules per course. Each module will usually consist of an interactive tutorial using Codio, followed by a quiz through Canvas, and lastly a programming project in Codio. In CC 410, there will also be several guided examples for you to follow and submit. The modules themselves are gated, which means that you much complete each item in the module before continuing. In addition, the modules enforce prerequisite requirements from other modules. For CC 410 you must complete them in order starting with module 0.</p>
<p>You are welcome to work on this course at any time during the week as your schedule allows, provided that you complete each module before the listed due date. There will be roughly one module due each week. Unlike other Computational Core courses, CC 410 does not include many auto-graded assignments. This is primarily due to the open-ended nature of the course. Instead, your code will be reviewed by an instructor or TA and you&rsquo;ll receive feedback through Canvas and Codio. In some instances, you may be encouraged to redo parts of an assignment for additional credit. We will strive to provide feedback on an assignment within one week of it being submitted.</p>
<p>[Slide 6]</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the rest of this introductory module, you’ll see that there are a few more items to be completed before you can move on. In the next video, I’ll discuss a bit more information about navigating through this course on Canvas and using the Codio learning environment.</p>
<p>[Slide 7]</p>
<p>One thing I highly encourage each of you to do is read the syllabus for this course in its entirety, and let us know if you have any questions. My view is that the syllabus is a contract between me as your teacher and you as a student, defining how each of us should treat each other and what we should expect from each other. We have made a few changes to the standard syllabus template for this program, and those changes are clearly highlighted. Finally, the syllabus itself is subject to change as needed as we adapt this program to meet the needs of its students, and all changes will be clearly communicated to everyone before they take effect.</p>
<p>[Slide 8]</p>
<p>One very important part of the syllabus that every student should read is the late work policy. First off, each module has a due date, and you may work on that module at any time before it is due, provided you have met the prerequisites. As discussed before, you must do all the readings and assignments in a module, preferably in listed order, before moving on, so you cannot jump ahead. A module is considered completed when all items have been completed.</p>
<p>[Slide 9]</p>
<p>For the purposes of grading, we will use the date and time that the confirmation quiz was submitted at the end of each module to determine when the module was completed. This is due to the way that Codio handles grading, as it may resubmit previously graded assignments if an error in the module is corrected, making a previously completed assignment appear to be submitted late.</p>
<p>If a module is completed after the due date, a penalty of 10% of the total points of each assignment will be deducted for each day the assignment is late. Therefore, if an assignment is submitted 3 days late, it will be subject to a 30% penalty of the total number of points possible on that assignment. After 10 days, no points will be awarded for a late submission.</p>
<p>However, even if a module is late, it still must be completed before you can move on to a later module. So, it is very important to avoid getting behind in this course, as it can be very difficult to get back on track. If you ever find that you are struggling to keep up, please don&rsquo;t be afraid to contact either the instructors or GTAs for assistance. We&rsquo;d be happy to help you get caught back up quickly.</p>
<p>The grading in this course is very simple. First, 10% of your final grade will depend on the grades you receive from each of the tutorials and quizzes throughout the course. Next, 10% of your grade will come from the interactive examples that precede several projects. The next 40% of your grade will come from the numerous project milestones throughout the course, of which there will be approximately 10. There will also be a couple of &ldquo;concept quizzes&rdquo; throughout the semester, which are a bit longer than a normal quiz and will ask you to apply what you&rsquo;ve learned to a novel situation. Those are worth 15% of your grade. Finally, the last 25% of your grade will come from the final project in the course, which will be discussed in a later video. In this program, the standard &ldquo;90-80-70-60&rdquo; grading scale will apply, though I reserve the right to curve grades up to a higher grade level at my discretion. Therefore, you will never be required to get higher than 90% for an A, but you may get an A if you score slightly below 90% if I choose to curve the grades.</p>
<p>[Slide 10]</p>
<p>This is intended to be a completely online, self-paced course. There are no mandatory scheduled course times. All of the content is available online, so you can work whenever and wherever you want. It could be a 3-hour block once a week, or a few minutes here and there between classes. It’s really up to you and your schedule. However, remember that each module may require 12 to 16 or more hours of work to complete, so make sure you have plenty of time available to devote to this course.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the flexible online format of this class, there won&rsquo;t be any long lecture videos to watch. Instead, each module will consist of a guided tutorial and several short videos, each focused on a particular topic or task. Likewise, there won&rsquo;t be any textbooks required, since all of the information will be presented in the interactive tutorials through Codio. Finally, since we are using Codio as our learning platform, you won&rsquo;t have to deal with installing and using a clunky integrated development environment, or IDE, just to learn how to program. Codio helps make learning to program quick and painless by moving everything to the web.</p>
<p>[Slide 11]</p>
<p>What hasn&rsquo;t changed, though, is the basic concept of a college course. You&rsquo;ll still be expected to watch or read about 6-9 hours of content to complete each module. In addition to that, each project assignment may require another 6-9 hours of work to complete. If you plan on doing a module each week, that roughly equates to 6 hours of content and 6 hours of homework each week, which is the expected workload from a 3-4 credit hour college course.</p>
<p>From my experience, I can definitely share that the number one reason students struggle in this class is due to poor time management, not the complexity of the material. So, make sure you are planning to dedicate enough time to this course, and strive to start assignments as soon as you receive them so you have lots of time to get help if you get stuck.</p>
<p>[Slide 12]</p>
<p>For this course, the only supplies you&rsquo;ll need as a student are access to a modern web browser and a broadband internet connection. No other special hardware or software is necessary! However, in this course you will also be able to do some development on your own computer using Visual Studio Code and Ubuntu. We&rsquo;ll provide some short videos to help you get started if you choose to go that route, but it is not required. Due to the complex nature of this course, we do not recommend using phones, tablets, or Chromebooks if you choose to do development on your own systems.</p>
<p>[Slide 13]</p>
<p>Finally, as you are aware, this course is always subject to change. This is a relatively new program here at K-State, and we’re always working on new and interesting ideas to integrate into the courses. The best advice I have is to look upon this graphic with the words “Don’t Panic” written in large, friendly letters.  If you find yourself falling behind, or not understanding seek our help via cc410-help.</p>
<p>[Slide 14]</p>
<p>So, to complete this module, there are a few other things that you&rsquo;ll need to do. The next step is to watch the video on navigating Canvas and Codio, which will give you a good idea of how to most effectively work through the content in this course.</p>

<p>This course makes extensive use of several features of Canvas which you may or may not have worked with before. To give you the best experience in this course, this video will briefly describe those features and the best way to access them.</p>
<p>When you first access the course on Canvas, you will be shown this homepage. It contains quick links to the course syllabus and Piazza discussion boards. This is handy if you just need to jump to a particular area.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through the options in the main menu to the left. The first section is Modules, which is where you&rsquo;ll primarily interact with the course. You&rsquo;ll notice that I&rsquo;ve disabled several of the common menu items in this course, such as Files and Assignments. This is to simplify things for you as students, so you remember that all the course content is available in one place.</p>
<p>When you first arrive at the Modules section, you&rsquo;ll see all of the content in the course laid out in order. If you like, you can minimize the modules you aren&rsquo;t working on by clicking the arrow to the left of the module name. I&rsquo;ll do so, leaving the introductory module open.</p>
<p>As you look at each module, you&rsquo;ll see that it gives quite a bit of information about the course. At the top of each module is an item telling you what parts of the module you must complete to continue. In this case, it says &ldquo;Complete All Items.&rdquo; Likewise, the following modules may list a number of prerequisite modules, which you must complete before you can access it.</p>
<p>Within each module is a set of items, which must be completed in listed order. Under each item you&rsquo;ll see information about what you must do in order to complete that item. For many of them, it will simply say <em>view</em>, which means you must view the item at least once to continue. Others may say <em>contribute</em>, <em>submit</em>, or give a minimum score required to continue. For assignments, it also helpfully gives the number of points available, and the due date.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s click on the first item, Course Introduction, to get started. You&rsquo;ve already been to this page by this point. Many course pages will consist of an embedded video, followed by links to any resources used or referenced in the video, including the slides and a downloadable version of the video. Finally, a rough video script will be posted on the page for your quick reference.</p>
<p>While I cannot force you to watch each video in its entirety, I highly recommend doing so. The script on the page may not accurately reflect all of the content in the video, nor can it show how to perform some tasks which are purely visual.</p>
<p>When you are ready to move to the next step in a module, click the <strong>Next</strong> button at the bottom of the page. Canvas will automatically add <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons to each piece of content which is accessed through the Modules section, which makes it very easy to work through the course content. I&rsquo;ll click through a couple of items here.</p>
<p>At any point, you may click on the Modules link in the menu to the left to return to the Modules section of the site. You&rsquo;ll notice that I&rsquo;ve viewed the first few items in the first module, so I can access more items here. This is handy if you want to go back and review the content you&rsquo;ve already seen, or if you leave and want to resume where you left off. Canvas will put green checkmarks to the right of items you&rsquo;ve completed.</p>
<p>Continuing down the menu to the left, you&rsquo;ll find the usual Canvas links to view your grades in the course, as well as a list of fellow students taking the course.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s go back to Canvas and load up one of the Codio projects. To load the first Codio projects, click the <strong>Next</strong> button at the bottom of this page to go to the next part of this module, which is the Codio Introduction tutorial. On that page, there will be a button to click, which opens Codio in a new browser window or tab.</p>
<p>Once Codio loads, it should give you the option to start the <em>Guide</em> for that module. You&rsquo;ll definitely want to select that option whenever you load a Codio project for the first time.</p>
<p>From there, you can follow the steps in that guide to learn more about the Codio interface. The first page of the guide continues this video. I&rsquo;ll see you there!</p>

<p>As you work on the materials in this course, you may run into questions or problems and need assistance. This video reviews the various types of help available to you in this course.</p>
<p>First and foremost, anytime you have a questions or need assistance in the Computational Core program, please send an email to the appropriate help group for this course. In this case, it would be cc410-help, or <a href="mailto:cc410-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com" rel="external" target="_blank">cc410-help@ksuemailprod.onmicrosoft.com</a>. That email goes to the instructors and GTAs, and is your best chance to get a quick response. We&rsquo;ll respond to your email within one business day.</p>
<p>Beyond email, there are a few resources you should be aware of. First, if you have any issues working with K-State Canvas, K-State IT resources, or any other technology related to the delivery of the course, your first source of help is the K-State IT Helpdesk. They can easily be reached via email at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ksu.edu" rel="external" target="_blank">helpdesk@ksu.edu</a>. Beyond them, there are many online resources for using Canvas, all of which are linked in the resources section below the video. As a last resort, you may also want to email the help group, but in most cases we may simply redirect you to the K-State helpdesk for assistance.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have any issues using the Codio platform, you are welcome to refer to their online documentation. Their support staff offers a quick and easy chat interface where you can ask questions and get feedback within a few minutes.</p>
<p>If you have issues with the technical content of the course, specifically related to completing the tutorials and projects, there are several resources available to you. First and foremost, make sure you consult the vast amount of material available in the course modules, including the links to resources. Usually, most answers you need can be found there.</p>
<p>If you are still stuck or unsure of where to go, the next best thing is to post your question as an email to the help group. As discussed earlier, the instructors and GTAs will do their best to help you as soon as they can.</p>
<p>Of course, as another step you can always exercise your information-gathering skills and use online search tools such as Google to answer your question. While you are not allowed to search online for direct solutions to assignments or projects, you are more than welcome to use Google to access programming resources such as StackOverflow, language documentation, and other tutorials. I can definitely assure you that programmers working in industry are often using Google and other online resources to solve problems, so there is no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t start building that skill now.</p>
<p>Next, we have grading and administrative issues. This could include problems or mistakes in the grade you received on a project, missing course resources, or any concerns you have regarding the course and the conduct of myself and your peers. Since this is an online course, you&rsquo;ll be interacting with us on a variety of online platforms, and sometimes things happen that are inappropriate or offensive. There are lots of resources at K-State to help you with those situations. First and foremost, please email me directly as soon as possible and let me know about your concern, if it is appropriate for me to be involved. If not, or if you&rsquo;d rather talk with someone other than me about your issue, I encourage you to contact either your academic advisor, the CS department staff, College of Engineering Student Services, or the K-State Office of Student Life. Finally, if you have any concerns that you feel should be reported to K-State, you can do so at <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/report/" rel="external" target="_blank">https://www.k-state.edu/report/</a>. That site also has links to a large number of resources at K-State that you can use when you need help.</p>
<p>Finally, if you find any errors or omissions in the course content, or have suggestions for additional resources to include in the course, email the help group. There are some extra credit points available for helping to improve the course, so be on the lookout for anything that you feel could be changed or improved.</p>
<p>So, in summary, reviewing the existing course content should always be your first stop when you have a question or run into a problem, since most issues can be solved there. If you are still stuck, email cc410-help to ask for assistance, and we&rsquo;ll get back to you within a business day. For issues with Canvas or Codio, you are also welcome to refer directly to the resources for those platforms. For grading questions and errors in the course content or any other issues, please email cc410-help or the instructors directly for assistance.</p>
<p>Our goal in this program is to make sure that you have the resources available to you to be successful. Please don&rsquo;t be afraid to take advantage of them and ask questions whenever you want.</p>

<h4 id="video-script">Video Script</h4>
<p>Before we launch into the course itself, I wanted to take a few minutes to share some information with you regarding what we know about how students learn to program. This isn&rsquo;t just anecdotal evidence from computer science teachers like me, but theories and research from education researchers who study how humans learn new skills and abilities throughout their lives.If I had to summarize all of this information in as few words as possible, I&rsquo;d simply say &ldquo;do the work.&rdquo; Learning to program is difficult, and the only way to really get good at it is through constant practice and learning. However, that greatly oversimplifies the information that I want to share, and I&rsquo;m hoping that you&rsquo;ll find some helpful takeaways from this video that you can incorporate into your learning process.</p>
<p>Before I begin, I want go give all the credit to Nathan Bean for developing this information as part of his CIS 400 course. He graciously allowed me to use his hard work here, and I encourage you to check out his original version, which is available at the URL shown on this slide.</p>
<p>The statement &ldquo;do the work&rdquo; is a shorter version of a very common quote from educators, which is &ldquo;the person doing the work is the person doing the learning.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t find a solid reference for who said it first, so I&rsquo;ll just attributed it to various educators throughout time. This really highlights one of the biggest struggles many students run into when learning to program. There are so many guides online, and the answer to many simple problems can be found through a quick Google search. You can just copy and paste the code, and then your program works. However, did you really <em>learn</em> how to write that program and what it does, or just how to find a quick answer? While this may be a useful tactic from time to time, if you rely too much on other people to do your coding, you really won&rsquo;t learn it yourself. This is just like learning to shoot free throws on a basketball court or beating your best time in a speedrun - you can&rsquo;t just watch someone do it and expect to do it yourself (believe me, I&rsquo;ve tried). So, if you aren&rsquo;t doing the work, you aren&rsquo;t really learning.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s address a major myth in computer science. I&rsquo;ve heard this many times: &ldquo;some people are just natural born programmers, and others simply cannot learn to program.&rdquo; And yes, on the surface, it may appear to be this way. Some students just seem to have a knack for programming, and you may sit and struggle and not really get anywhere. However, there is no innate skill or ability that makes you good at programming.</p>
<p>Instead, let&rsquo;s reframe what it means to learn programming. At its core, programming is learning to write steps to solve problems in a way that a computer can perform those steps. That&rsquo;s really what we are doing when we learn programming.</p>
<p>So, we must focus on learning how to write those steps with the proper exactitude and precision so that they make sense, and we must understand how a computer functions to be able to program that computer effectively. So, when you see someone who is good at programming, it&rsquo;s not because they are good at some esoteric skill that you&rsquo;ll never have - they just know how to express their steps properly and know enough about how a computer works to make their program do what they want. That&rsquo;s really it! And, to be honest, after a single semester of learning to program, you&rsquo;ll have all the skills you need to do both of those things! If you know how to make conditionals, loops, functions, and use simple variables and arrays, that&rsquo;s really all you need. Everything else that comes after that is just refining those skills to make your programs more powerful and your coding more efficient.</p>
<p>So, how do we learn these skills? Well, there are a couple of important pieces we need to make sure are in the right place first. For starters, we need to have the correct mindset. Many times I&rsquo;ll see students struggle to learn how to program, and they&rsquo;ll say things like what you see on this slide. &ldquo;Its too hard.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this.&rdquo; &ldquo;I give up.&rdquo; Statements like this are the sign of a &ldquo;fixed mindset,&rdquo; and they can be one of the greatest blockers preventing you from really learning to program. Just like learning any other skill, you have to be open to instruction and willing to learn, or else you&rsquo;ve failed before you even started.</p>
<p>Instead, we want to focus on building a growth mindset. In the TED talk by Carol Dweck that is linked below this video, which I encourage you to watch, she talks about the power of &ldquo;yet.&rdquo; We can turn these statements around by simply adding positive power of &ldquo;yet&rdquo; - &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this yet.&rdquo; &ldquo;I love a good challenge.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep trying until I get it.&rdquo; Going into a programming project with a mindset that is open to growth and change is really an important first steps. When I feel like I&rsquo;m getting a fixed mindset, I like to think about how difficult it would be to teach a child to tie their shoes if they don&rsquo;t want to learn. As soon as I realize that, it is pretty easy to recognize that same problem in myself and work to correct it.</p>
<p>So, once we have our growth mindset, how do we actually learn to program? To understand that, let&rsquo;s dive a bit into the world of educational theory and the work of Jean Piaget. Piaget was a biologist and psychologist who studied how young children acquired new knowledge, and he helped pioneer the concept of Constructivism, one of the most influential philosophies in education. You can read more about Constructivism in the links below this video.</p>
<p>One particular thing that Piaget worked on was a theory of genetic epistemology. Epistemology is the term for the study of human knowledge, so <em>genetic</em> epistemology is the study of the origins, or genesis, of that knowledge. Put more clearly, it&rsquo;s the study of how humans create new knowledge. This concept was inspired by research done on snails - he was able to prove that two previously distinct species of snails were actually the same by moving snails from one habitat to another and observing how they modified their behaviors and how their shells grew to match the snails in the new habitat. Put clearly, the snails displayed an altered behavior based on their environment. They tried to exist in equilibrium with their environment by adapting their behaviors to fit what they now experienced in the word.</p>
<p>Piaget suspected that something similar happens when humans try to learn something - the brain tries to adapt itself to maintain an equilibrium in its environment, which in this case is the existing knowledge it contains. So, when the brain is exposed to new ideas, it must somehow adjust to account for that new information. Piaget proposed two different mechanisms for how this occurs: assimilation and accommodation. In assimilation, new knowledge can be added to existing structures in the brain. For example, if you are exposed to a new color, such as periwinkle, you can see that it falls somewhere between blue and violet, two colors you already know. So, you can assimilate that new knowledge into the existing knowledge without a major disruption to your mental structure of existing colors. Accommodation, on the other hand, happens when your brain must radically adapt to new information for which no existing structures exist. This can be very difficult, and can lead to a lot of struggle and frustration when trying to get &ldquo;over the hump&rdquo; on a new subject. Think about learning algebra or a new language for the first time - you really don&rsquo;t have anything you can use to help understand this new material, so you just have to keep at it until those new structures are formed in your brain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to achieve accommodation, your brain simply has to build brand new structures to store and represent all of this new information, and that process is difficult and takes time. Put another way, it takes significant stimulus, usually in the form of doing homework, struggling with difficult problems and wrestling with the new information to try and understand it all, to create enough disequilibrium in your brain that, coupled with a growth mindset, will allow accommodation to occur. However, when all the pieces are in the right place, and you work hard and have a growth mindset, then&hellip;</p>
<p>EUREKA! The structures will form, and you&rsquo;ll get over that huge hurdle, and things will start falling into place. It may not happen all at once, but it does happen (you&rsquo;ve probably had it happen to you several times already - think about some eureka moments from your past - were they related to learning a new skill?). Of course, there&rsquo;s a good chance that your brain might form a few incorrect structures in the process, so you&rsquo;ll have to overcome those as you continue to learn. I still struggle to spell some words because my brain formed incorrect structures when I was still learning. But, if you continue to work hard and be open to learning, you&rsquo;ll eventually sort those errors out as well.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one other concept in education, which is called stage theory. Piaget identified four stages that children go through as they learn to reason about the world. Those four stages are shown on this slide. In the <strong>sensorimotor</strong> stage, the child is just using their senses to interact with the world, without any real understanding of what will happen when they perform an action. This is best represented by babies and toddlers, who touch and taste everything in their surroundings. Next, the <strong>preoperational</strong> stage is represented in young children as they start to think symbolically about the world, using pictures and words to represent actions and objects. They then progress to the <strong>concrete operational</strong> stage, where they can begin to think logically and understand how concrete events happen. They can also start to think inductively, building the general principles of the world from their specific experiences. For example, if they observe that cooked spaghetti is better than raw spaghetti, they might reason that other foods like potatoes are better cooked than raw. Finally, the last stage is the <strong>formal operational</strong> stage. This stage is represented by the ability to work fully with an abstract work, formulating and testing hypotheses to truly understand how the world works and predict how new items will work before experiencing them firsthand.</p>
<p>Many later researchers built upon this model to show that adults learn in much the same way. They also discovered that the stages are not rigid, and you may exhibit behaviors from multiple stages at any given time. This is called the &ldquo;overlapping waves&rdquo; model, and is shown here in this diagram. So, as you learn new skills, you may be at the operational stage in some areas, but still at the preoperational stage in other areas. This explains why some concepts may make sense while others don&rsquo;t for a while - you just have to keep going until it all fits together.</p>
<p>So, how can we apply all of this information to programming? One theory comes from the work of Lister and Teague, who proposed a developmental epistemology of computer programming. Put another way, they applied this theory to computer science education, and gave us a unique way to think about the different stages of learning to program.</p>
<p>At the sensorimotor stage, we&rsquo;re just getting the basics. So, when given a piece of code and asked to trace what it does, we still make lots of errors and get the answer incorrect. If we want to get a program to work ourselves, it usually involves a lot of trial and error, and many times when it does end up working we don&rsquo;t even know exactly <em>why</em> it worked that time, but we&rsquo;re building up a baseline of information that we can use to construct our mental model of how a computer works.</p>
<p>As we progress into the preoperational stage, we become better at tracing code correctly, but we still struggle to understand what the program itself does. We see each line of code as a separate instruction, but not the entire program. A great analogy is reading a recipe that calls for flour, water, salt, and yeast. Will it make bread? Biscuits? Pie crust? We&rsquo;re not sure yet, but at least we can recognize the ingredients. To solve problems at this stage, we typically will randomly adjust pieces of our code that we don&rsquo;t quite understand and see what it does, trying to form a better idea of the importance of each line in the code.</p>
<p>Eventually, we&rsquo;ll get to the concrete operational stage. At this stage, we can construct our own programs, but many times we are simply piecing together parts that we&rsquo;ve used before and performing some futile patches and bugfixes as we refine the program. We can also work backwards to figure out what a program does from execution results, but we still aren&rsquo;t very good at deducing the results from the code itself. However, we&rsquo;re starting to work with abstraction, though we tend to simplify things to a level that we are more comfortable with.</p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll reach the formal operational stage. At this stage, we can comfortable read and understand code without executing it, quickly seeing what it does and how it works without fully tracing it ourselves. We can also start to form hypotheses for how to build new programs and code, and reason about whether different approaches would work better or worse than others. This is the goal stage for any programmer! Once you have reached this stage, then you&rsquo;ll feel totally at home working in code and developing your own programs from scratch.</p>
<p>So, how can we enable ourselves to be the best learners we can be? There is lots of interesting research in that area, best summarized in the book &ldquo;The New Science of Learning&rdquo; that is linked below this video. Let&rsquo;s go through a few of the big concepts.</p>
<p>First, getting ample and regular sleep is important, because it allows your brain to build those knowledge structures we discussed earlier and store the memories from the day in long-term storage. Without enough sleep, your brain is unable to process memories offline and make them ready for retrieval later on, an important step in learning. Also, consuming large amounts of caffeine or alcohol can disrupt your sleep patterns, so keep that in mind before you pour that next cup of coffee or go out partying. You can also take advantage of modern technology to help you track your sleep - most smart watches and smartphones today can help with that!</p>
<p>Likewise, regular exercise is important to both your physical and mental health. When you exercise, especially aerobic exercise that gets your heart rate up, your body releases neurochemicals that help your brain cells communicate. In addition, just getting up and moving around regularly helps keep your body healthy, so take regular breaks, and consider getting a standing desk for some extra benefits.</p>
<p>Research also shows that engaging your senses is an important part in learning. This is why we, as teachers, try to vary our lessons with pictures, videos, activities, and more. It is also the basis of the cognitive apprenticeship style of learning that we use, which you can learn more about in the links below this video. We show you the code we are writing, engaging your sense of vision, while talking about it so you are also listening, and then you are writing your own version, using your sense of touch. You can build upon this by using your senses while you learn by taking notes during a lecture video, building concept maps, and even printing out and writing on your code and these lecture scripts. All of these processes help engage different parts of your brain and make it that much easier to build new knowledge structures.</p>
<p>Looking for patterns is another important way to understand programming. There are many common patterns in computer programs, such as using a for loop to iterate through an array, or an if-else statement to determine if a particular variable is set to a valid value. By recognizing and understanding those patterns, we can more quickly understand new programs that use slightly different versions of the same code. Humans are naturally very good at pattern recognition, and it is one of the reasons why we see the same code structures time and time again - not because they are the only way to accomplish that goal, but because that structure is commonly used across many programs and therefore is easier to understand.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of research into how memories are formed and how we can adjust our studying habits to take advantage of that. For example, cognitive science shows that the parts of our brain responsible for memory creation are active up to <em>one hour</em> after a learning experience has ended, such as a lecture video or activity. So, instead of jumping to the next task, you may want to take a little while to reflect on what you just did and let it sink in before moving on. Likewise, to build strong memories, it is important to constantly recall the memory or use the skills you&rsquo;ve learned to strengthen their structures in the brain. This is why teachers like to throw in a few questions from a previous exam or quiz every once in a while - it helps strengthen those structures by forcing you to recall information you&rsquo;ve learned previously. On the other hand, many students try to &ldquo;cram&rdquo; a bunch of information right before an exam, only to forget it soon after because it wasn&rsquo;t recalled more than once. As you progress further, we&rsquo;ll continue to come back to concepts you&rsquo;ve already learned and build upon them, a process called <em>elaboration</em> that helps reinforce what you&rsquo;ve already learned while building new, related knowledge.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to remember that we must give our brains the space it needs to focus on the task at hand. Multitasking while learning, such as watching YouTube or Twitch, chatting with friends, or listening to a lecture video while coding can all reduce your brain&rsquo;s ability to form strong memories and do well. In fact, research shows that individuals who try to multitask tend to make 50% more errors and spend 50% more time on both tasks. So, instead of giving yourself distractions, try to find things that will help you focus better - there are some great playlists online for music without lyrics that can help you focus or code better, and you can easily mute notifications on your phone and on your computer for an hour or so while you work.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s summarize what we&rsquo;ve covered here. First, and most importantly, remember that you <em>can</em> learn to program, just like the many students who have done it before you. However, it can be difficult and frustrating at times, and it will take lots of hard work on your part to make it happen. That means that you&rsquo;ll need to read and write <em>a lot</em> of code before it really starts to make sense. In short, you must <strong>do the work</strong> to learn to program.</p>
<p>That said, you can help make the process easier by getting good sleep, exercising regularly, and engaging fully with all of the content in the course. That means you&rsquo;ll need to take your own notes, maybe draw some diagrams, and annotate code you write and code you read to help you understand it. While you are working, try not to multitask so you can focus. If you are given some code to include in your program, don&rsquo;t copy/paste it - rewrite it, and make sure you completely understand what each line does. Finally, take some time to read code written by others! GitHub is a great place to discover all sorts of code and see how others write code. If you want to write good poetry you have to read lots of good poetry, and the same goes for coding.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I hope you are able to make the best of this course and continue to develop your programming skills. If you are interested in this topic and would like to know more about things you can do to be a better learner, let us know! As you can imagine, teachers like me love to talk about this stuff, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask. Good luck!</p>

<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<p>These courses are being taught 100% online, and each module is self-paced. There may be some bumps in the road as we refine the overall course structure. Students will work at their own pace through a set of modules, with approximately one module being due each week. Material will be provided in the form of recorded videos, online tutorials, links to online resources, and discussion prompts. Each module will include a coding project or assignment, many of which will be graded automatically through Codio. Assignments may also include portions which will be graded manually via Canvas or other tools.</p>
<p>A common axiom in learner-centered teaching is <strong>&ldquo;the person doing the work is the person doing the learning.&rdquo;</strong> What this really means is that students primarily learn through grappling with the concepts and skills of a course while attempting to apply them. Simply seeing a demonstration or hearing a lecture by itself doesn’t do much in terms of learning. This is not to say that they don&rsquo;t serve an important role - as they set the stage for the learning to come, helping you to recognize the core ideas to focus on as you work. The work itself consists of applying ideas, practicing skills, and putting the concepts into your own words.</p>
<h3 id="the-work">The Work</h3>
<p>There is no shortcut to becoming a great programmer. Only by <strong>doing the work</strong> will you develop the skills and knowledge to make you a successful computer scientist. This course is built around that principle, and gives you ample opportunity to do the work, with as much support as we can offer.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorials, Quizzes &amp; Examples:</strong> Each module will include many tutorial assignments, quizzes, and examples that will take you step-by-step through using a particular concept or technique. The point is not simply to complete the example, but to practice the technique and coding involved. You will be expected to implement these techniques on your own in the milestone assignment of the module - so this practice helps prepare you for those assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Programming Assignments:</strong> Throughout the semester you will be building several programming projects that explore the topics, data structures, and algorithms introduced in this class. Each programming project may include multiple tasks and an automated grading system.</p>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>In theory, each student begins the course with an A. As you submit work, you can either maintain your A (for good work) or chip away at it (for less adequate or incomplete work). In practice, each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total earned out of the possible number of points. In this course, each assignment constitutes a portion of the final grade, as detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>70% - Codio Programming Projects</li>
<li>30% - Codio Tutorials and Canvas Quizzes</li>
</ul>
<p>Up to 5% of the total grade in the class is available as extra credit. See the <strong>Extra Credit - Bug Bounty</strong> &amp; <strong>Extra Credit - Helping Hands</strong> assignments for details.</p>
<p>Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% - 100% → A</li>
<li>80% - 89.99% → B</li>
<li>70% - 79.99% → C</li>
<li>60% - 69.99% → D</li>
<li>00% - 59.99% → F</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="collaboration-policy">Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>In this course, all work submitted by a student should be created solely by the student without any outside assistance beyond the instructor and TA/GTAs. Students may seek outside help or tutoring regarding concepts presented in the course, but should not share or receive any answers, source code, program structure, or any other materials related to the course. Learning to debug coding problems is a vital skill, and students should strive to ask good questions and perform their own research instead of just sharing broken source code when asking for assistance.</p>
<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won&rsquo;t apply to you!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since this course is entirely online, students may work at any time and at their own pace through the modules. However, to keep everyone on track, there will be approximately one module due each week. Each graded item in the module will have a specific due date specified. <strong>Any assignment submitted late will have that assignment&rsquo;s grade reduced by 10% of the total possible points on that project for each day it is late. This penalty will be assessed automatically in the Canvas gradebook.</strong> For the purposes of record keeping, a combination of the time of a submission via Canvas and the creation of a release in GitHub will be used to determine if the assignment was submitted on time.</p>
<p>However, even if a module is not submitted on time, it must still be completed before a student is allowed to begin the next module. So, students should take care not to get too far behind, as it may be very difficult to catch up.</p>
<p>Finally, all course work must be submitted on or before the last day of the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course in order for it to be graded on time.</p>
<p>If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.</p>
<h3 id="incomplete-policy">Incomplete Policy</h3>
<p>Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.</p>
<p>If you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion. See the official <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/students/academicpolicy/#GRADING" rel="external" target="_blank">K-State Grading Policy</a> for more information. In general, <em>poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade</em>.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted in writing on a signed <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/forms/Incomplete%20agreement%20form.docx" rel="external" target="_blank">Incomplete Agreement Form</a>, the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in Computational Core courses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students may receive at most two incompletes in Computational Core courses throughout their time in the program</li>
<li>Students will be given 6 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester&rsquo;s finals week to complete the course</li>
<li>Any modules in a future CC course which depend on incomplete work will not be accessible until the previous course is finished</li>
<li>For example, if a student is given an incomplete in CC 210, then all modules in CC 310 will be inaccessible until CC 210 is complete</li>
<li>Students understand that access to instructor and GTA assistance may be limited after the end of an academic semester due to holidays and other obligations</li>
<li>If a student fails to resolve an incomplete grade after 6 weeks, they will be assigned an &lsquo;F&rsquo; in the course. In addition, they will be dropped from any other Computational Core courses which require the failed course as a prerequisite or corequisite.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommended-texts--supplies">Recommended Texts &amp; Supplies</h3>
<p>To participate in this course, students must have access to a modern web browser and broadband internet connection. All course materials will be provided via Canvas and Codio. Modules may also contain links to external resources for additional information, such as programming language documentation.</p>
<h3 id="subject-to-change">Subject to Change</h3>
<p>The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students. All changes may also be posted to Canvas.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one&rsquo;s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/honor/" rel="external" target="_blank">Honor and Integrity System</a> apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: &ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&rdquo; A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.</p>
<p><strong>For this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in sanctions such as a 0 on the assignment or an XF in the course, depending on severity. Actively seeking unauthorized aid, such as posting lab assignments on sites such as Chegg or StackOverflow, or asking another person to complete your work, even if unsuccessful, will result in an immediate XF in the course.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This course assumes that all your course work will be done by you. Use of AI text and code generators such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot in any submission for this course is strictly forbidden unless explicitly allowed by your instructor. Any unauthorized use of these tools without proper attribution is a violation of the <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/honor/basics/pledge.html" rel="external" target="_blank">K-State Honor Pledge</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the <em>context</em> and <em>body language</em> of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker <em>means</em>, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.</p>
<p>Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Canvas or Discord:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.</strong> Subject lines such as &ldquo;Question&rdquo; or &ldquo;Problem&rdquo; are not helpful. Subjects such as &ldquo;Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python&rdquo; give plenty of information about your topic.</li>
<li><strong>Use only one topic per message.</strong> If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.</li>
<li><strong>Be thorough, concise, and to the point.</strong> Ideally, each message should be a page or less.</li>
<li><strong>Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.</strong> It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you&rsquo;ve tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Consider carefully what you write before you post it.</strong> Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.</li>
<li><strong>If you are lost, don&rsquo;t know an answer, or don&rsquo;t understand something, speak up!</strong> Email and Canvas both allow you to send a message privately to the instructors, so other students won&rsquo;t see that you asked a question. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students.</li>
<li><strong>Class discussions are confidential.</strong> Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.</li>
<li><strong>Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts.</strong> When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.</li>
<li><strong>Do not use all caps.</strong> It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.</li>
<li><strong>No feigning surprise.</strong> If someone asks a question, saying things like &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo; are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.</li>
<li><strong>No &ldquo;well-actually&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</strong> If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a &ldquo;well, actually&hellip;&rdquo; correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don&rsquo;t post a correction just for the sake of being correct.</li>
<li><strong>Do not correct someone&rsquo;s grammar or spelling.</strong> Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.</strong> Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.</strong> They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates by adhering to the <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/" rel="external" target="_blank">K-State Principles of Community</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&rdquo; - K-State Honor Pledge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plagiarism is a very serious concern in this course, and something that we do not take lightly. Computer programs and code are especially easy targets for plagiarism due to how easy it is to copy and manipulate code in such a way that it is unrecognizable as the original source but still performs correctly.</p>
<p>At its core, plagiarism is taking someone else&rsquo;s work and passing it off as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original source. As a student at K-State, you are bound by the K-State Honor Code not to accept any unauthorized aid, and this includes plagiarized code.</p>
<p>When it comes to plagiarism in computer code, there is a fine line between using resources appropriately and copying code. In this program, you should strive to avoid plagiarism issues by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not search for or use any complete solutions to projects in this course found online or from fellow students.</li>
<li>Small portions of code may be used or adapted from an online source with proper citation. To cite a piece of code, include a code comment section above it that contains the original source URL and a description of why it was used.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, copying or adapting small pieces of code to perform auxiliary functions in the assignment is permitted. Copying or adapting code that is the general goal of the assignment should be avoided. For example, if the assignment is to create a bubble sort algorithm, you should write the algorithm from scratch yourself since that is the goal of the assignment. If the assignment is to create a program for displaying data that you feel should be sorted, you may choose to adapt an existing sorting algorithm for your needs (or use one from a library).</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t sure about whether it is OK to use an online resource or piece of code in this course, please contact the instructors using the course discussion forums or help email address. You will not get in trouble for asking, and it will help you determine what the best course of action is. Plagiarism can really only occur when you submit the assignment for grading, so you are welcome to ask for clarification or a judgement on whether a particular usage is acceptable at any time before you submit the assignment.</p>
<p>Codio has features that will compare your submissions against those of your fellow students. Any submissions with a high degree of similarity may be subjected to additional scrutiny by the instructors to determine if plagiarism has occurred.</p>
<p>In this course, any violation of the K-State Honor Code will result in a 0 on that assignment and a report made to the K-State Honor Council. A second violation will result in an XF in this course, as well as any additional sanctions imposed by the K-State Honor Council.</p>

<p><em>Programming</em> is the act of writing <em>source code</em> for a computer program in such a way that a modern computer can understand and perform the steps described in the code. There are many different <em>programming languages</em> that can be used, such as <em>high-level languages</em> like Java and Python.</p>
<p>To run code written in those languages, we can use a <em>compiler</em> to convert the code to a <em>low-level language</em> that can be directly executed by the computer, or we can use an <em>interpreter</em> to read the code and perform the requested operations on the computer.</p>
<p>At this point, we have most likely written some programs already. This chapter will review the important aspects of our chosen programming language, giving us a solid basis to build upon. Hopefully most of this will be review, but there may be a few new terms or concepts introduced here as well.</p>

<h1 id="flowcharts-and-pseudocode">Flowcharts and Pseudocode</h1>

<p>In this course, we will primarily be learning different ways to store and manipulate data in our programs. Of course, we could do this using the source code of our chosen programming language, but in many cases that would defeat the purpose of learning how to do it ourselves!</p>
<p>Instead, we will use several different ways to represent the steps required to build our programs. Let&rsquo;s review a couple of them now.</p>
<h2 id="natural-language">Natural Language</h2>
<p>One of the simplest ways to describe a computer program is to simply write what it does using our preferred language, such as English. Of course, natural language can be very ambiguous, so we must be careful to make our written descriptions as precise as possible. So, it is a good idea to limit ourselves to simple, clear sentences that aren&rsquo;t written as prose. It may seem a bit boring, but this is the best way to make sure our intent is completely understood.</p>
<p>A great example is a recipe for baking. Each step is written clearly and concisely, with enough descriptive words used to allow anyone to read and follow the directions.</p>
<h2 id="flowcharts">Flowcharts</h2>
<p><a href="#R-image-f142ebd467966ab23b0599eecf1cb4db" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Programming Flowchart Template" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.2.template.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-f142ebd467966ab23b0599eecf1cb4db"><img alt="Programming Flowchart Template" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.2.template.png"></a></p>
<p>One method of representing computer programs is through the use of <em>flowcharts</em>. A flowchart consists of graphical blocks representing individual operations to be performed, connected with arrows which describe the flow of the program. The image above gives the basic building blocks of the flowcharts that will be used in this course. We will mostly follow the flowchart design used by the <a href="http://www.flowgorithm.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Flowgorithm</a> program available online. The following pages in this chapter will introduce and discuss each block in detail.</p>
<h2 id="pseudocode">Pseudocode</h2>
<p>We can also express our computer programs through the use of pseudocode. <em>Pseudocode</em> is an abstract language that resembles a high-level programming language, but it is written in such a way that it can be easily understood by any programmer who is familiar with any one of several common languages. The pseudocode may not be directly executable as written, but it should contain enough detail to be easily understood and adapted to an actual programming language by a skilled programmer.</p>
<p>There are many standards that exist for pseudocode, each with their own unique features and uses. In this course, we will mostly follow the standards from the <a href="https://ib.compscihub.net/programming/pseudo-code" rel="external" target="_blank">International Baccalaureate Organization</a>. In the following pages in this chapter, we&rsquo;ll also introduce pseudocode for each of the flowchart blocks shown above.</p>

<h1 id="syntax-overview">Syntax Overview</h1>

<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss some of the basic concepts we need to understand about the Python programming language.</p>
<h2 id="program-structure">Program Structure</h2>
<p>To begin, let&rsquo;s look at a simple Hello World program written in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&#34;Hello World!&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># main guard</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&#34;__main__&#34;</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This program contains multiple important parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we define a function called <code>main()</code>. Python does not require us to do this, since we can write our code directly in the file and it will execute. However, since we are going to be building larger programs in this course, it is a good idea to start using functions now.</li>
<li>The function definition ends with a colon <code>:</code>, and then the code inside of that function comes directly after it. The code contained in the function must be indented a single level. By convention, Python files should use 4 spaces to indent the code. Thankfully, Codio does that for us automatically.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the file, we&rsquo;ve included a <strong>main guard</strong> that determines if this file is being executed. If it is, it will call the <code>main()</code> function to run the program.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, this is a very brief overview for the Python programming language. To learn more, feel free to refer to the references listed below, as well as the textbook content for previous courses.</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve written our first Python program, we must run the program to see the fruits of our labors. There are many different ways to do this using the Codio platform. We&rsquo;ll discuss each of them in detail here.</p>
<h2 id="terminal">Terminal</h2>
<p>Codio includes a built-in Linux terminal, which allows us to perform actions directly on a command-line interface just like we would on an actual computer running Linux. We can access the Terminal in many ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selecting the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, then choosing the <strong>Terminal</strong> option</li>
<li>Pressing SHIFT + ALT + T in any Codio window (you can customize this shortcut in your Codio user preferences)</li>
<li>Pressing the <strong>Open Terminal</strong> icon in the file tree</li>
<li>Selecting the <strong>Open Terminal</strong> option from the <strong>Run</strong> menu (it is the first menu to the right of the <strong>Help</strong> menu)</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, some pages may already open a terminal window for us in the left-hand pane, as this page so helpfully does. As we can see, we&rsquo;re never very far away from a terminal.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag">YouTube Video</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the terminal window and navigate to our program. When we first open the Terminal window, it should show us a prompt that looks somewhat like this one:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-b0a02ea92eb5049feffbabef1a756345" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Initial Terminal View" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.j.3.terminal1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-b0a02ea92eb5049feffbabef1a756345"><img alt="Initial Terminal View" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.j.3.terminal1.png"></a></p>
<p>There is quite a bit of information there, but we&rsquo;re interested in the last little bit of the last line, where it says <code>~/workspace</code>. That is the current directory, or folder, our terminal is looking at, also known as our <em>working directory</em>. We can always find the full location of our working directory by typing the <code>pwd</code> command, short for &ldquo;Print Working Directory,&rdquo; in the terminal. Let&rsquo;s try it now!</p>
<p>Enter this command in the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">pwd</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and we should see output similar to this:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-96046734c3440d7ab54e7553a46ee346" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="pwd Command Output" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.j.3.pwd.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-96046734c3440d7ab54e7553a46ee346"><img alt="pwd Command Output" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.j.3.pwd.png"></a></p>
<p>In that output, we&rsquo;ll see that the full path to our working directory is <code>/home/codio/workspace</code>. This is the default location for all of our content in Codio, and it&rsquo;s where everything shown in the file tree to the far left is stored. When working in Codio, we&rsquo;ll always want to store our work in this directory.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s use the <code>ls</code> command, short for &ldquo;LiSt,&rdquo; to see a list of all of the items in that directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">ls</span></span></code></pre></div><p><a href="#R-image-6a0054b7430d51ccbd0a2c6936618aff" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="ls Command Output" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.j.3.ls.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-6a0054b7430d51ccbd0a2c6936618aff"><img alt="ls Command Output" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.j.3.ls.png"></a></p>
<p>We should see a whole list of items appear in the terminal. Most of them are directories containing examples for the chapters this textbook, including the <code>HelloWorld.py</code> file that we edited in the last page. Thankfully, the directories are named in a very logical way, making it easy for us to find what we need. For example, to find the directory for Chapter 1 that contains examples for Python, look for the directory with the name starting with <code>1p</code>. In this case, it would be <code>1p-hello</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, we can use the <code>cd</code> command, short for &ldquo;Change Directory,&rdquo; to change the working directory. To change to the <code>1p-hello</code> directory, type <code>cd</code> into the terminal window, followed by the name of that directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">cd</span> 1p-hello</span></span></code></pre></div><p><a href="#R-image-f16ca8252062696d96484d9ab0503d07" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="cd Command Output" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.p.3.cd.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-f16ca8252062696d96484d9ab0503d07"><img alt="cd Command Output" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.p.3.cd.png"></a></p>
<p>We are now in the <code>1p-hello</code> directory, as we can see by observing the <code>~/workspace/1p-hello</code> on the current line in the terminal. Finally, we can do the <code>ls</code> command again to see the files in that directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">ls</span></span></code></pre></div><p><a href="#R-image-1882b655627ad7aa1dfc02a7cddcdb1e" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="ls Command Output" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.p.3.ls2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-1882b655627ad7aa1dfc02a7cddcdb1e"><img alt="ls Command Output" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.p.3.ls2.png"></a></p>
<p>We should see our <code>HelloWorld.py</code> file! If it doesn&rsquo;t appear, try using this command to get to the correct directory: <code>cd /home/codio/workspace/1p-hello</code>.</p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;re at the point where we can see the <code>HelloWorld.py</code> file, we can move on to actually running the program.</p>
<h2 id="running-in-terminal">Running in Terminal</h2>
<p>To run it, we just need to type the following in the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">python3 HelloWorld.py</span></span></code></pre></div><p><a href="#R-image-a787b28c5205058757bc8513bb2f6041" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="python Command Output" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.p.3.python.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-a787b28c5205058757bc8513bb2f6041"><img alt="python Command Output" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.p.3.python.png"></a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it! We&rsquo;ve now successfully run our first Python program. Of course, we can run the program as many times as we want by repeating the previous <code>python3</code> command. If we make changes to the HelloWorld.py file that instruct the computer to do something different, we should see those changes the next time we run the file..</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Problems?</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>If the <code>python3</code> command doesn&rsquo;t give you any output, or gives you an error message, that most likely means that your code has an error in it. Go back to the previous page and double-check that the contents of <code>HelloWorld.py</code> exactly match what is shown at the bottom of the page. You can also read the error message output by <code>python3</code> to determine what might be going wrong in your file.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you use the <code>python3</code> command and not just <code>python</code>. The <code>python3</code> command references the newer Python 3 interpreter, while the <code>python</code> command is used for the older Python 2 interpreter. In this book, we&rsquo;ll be using Python 3, so you&rsquo;ll need to always make sure you use <code>python3</code> when you run your code.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll cover information about simple debugging steps on the next page as well. If you get stuck, now is a great time to go to the instructors and ask for assistance. You aren&rsquo;t in this alone!</p>

<h2 id="codio-assessments">Codio Assessments</h2>
<p>Last, but not least, many of the Codio tutorials and projects in this program will include assessments that we must solve by writing code. Codio can then automatically run the program and check for specific things, such as the correct output, in order to give us a grade. For most of these questions, we&rsquo;ll be able to make changes to our code as many times as we&rsquo;d like to get the correct answer.</p>
<p>As we can see, there are many different ways to compile and run our code using Codio. Feel free to use any of these methods throughout this course.</p>

<h1 id="debugging">Debugging</h1>

<p>Codio also includes an integrated debugger, which is very helpful when we want to determine if there is an error in our code. We can also use the debugger to see what values are stored in each variable at any point in our program.</p>
<p>To use the debugger, find the <strong>Debug Menu</strong> at the top of the Codio window. It is to the right of the Run Menu we&rsquo;ve already been using. On that menu, we should see an option for <strong>Python - Debug File</strong>. Select that option to run our program in the Codio debugger.</p>
<p>As we build more complex programs in this course, we&rsquo;ll be able to configure our own debugger configurations that allow us to test multiple files and operations.</p>
<p>The Codio debugger only works with input from a file, not from the terminal. So, to use the debugger, we&rsquo;ll need to make sure the input we&rsquo;d like to test is stored in a file, such as <code>input.txt</code>, before debugging. We can then give that file as an argument to our program in our debugger configuration, and write our program to read input from a file if one is provided as an argument.</p>
<p>Learning how to use a debugger is a hands-on process, and is probably best described in a video. You can find more information in the Codio documentation to get up to speed on working in the Codio debugger.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.codio.com/common/develop/ide/debugger/debugger.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Codio Documentation - Debugger</a></p>
<p>We can always use the debugger to help us find problems in our code.</p>
<h2 id="visualizer">Visualizer</h2>

<p>Codio now includes support for <a href="http://pythontutor.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Python Tutor</a>, allowing us to visualize what is happening in our code. We can see that output in the second tab that is open to the left.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, students are not able to open the visualizer directly, so it must be configured by an instructor in the Codio lesson. If you find a page in this textbook where you&rsquo;d like to be able to visualize your code, please let us know!</p>

<h1 id="variables">Variables</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk4XkiGKick">YouTube Video</a>

<p>A variable in a programming language is an abstraction that allows storing one value in each instant of time, but this value can change along with the program execution. A variable can be represented as a box holding a value. If the variable is a container, e.g., a list (or array or vector), a matrix, a tuple, or a set of values, each box in the container contains a single value.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
<p>A variable is characterized by:</p>
<ol>
<li>An identifier or <strong>name</strong>. The name represents the most important information since it allows us to identify the variable inside the program. This name has to be unique inside the program and it allows us to identify the variable. In order to improve program legibility, and facilitate debugging,  and understanding it is important to choose a <em>representative</em> name for the variable that clearly represents the function of the variable. <em>Representative</em> names could be <code>results</code>, <code>number_of_nodes</code>, <code>number_of_edges</code>. For writing variable names composed of two or more words in Python we can use underscores to separate the words.</li>
<li>A single <strong>value</strong>, i.e. the value that is stored in the variable. The value of the variable can be modified during program execution but at each instant of time, the variable holds a single value.</li>
<li>A <strong>data type</strong>. The data type characterizes the set of values that the variable can take. For example, the integer type contains numbers without a decimal part. The decimal or floating point type contains numbers with a decimal part. In mathematics, we call these real numbers. The string type (text) characterizes character sequences, and the Boolean type contains true or false values and is used to hold the result of the conditions. In some untyped languages, like Scratch and Python, the data type is deduced from the value that contains the variable. Since the value can change, its type can also change. For example, a variable can contain an integer value at the beginning of the program, a value that is subsequently changed to a real number. In other programming languages, such as Java, the type must be explicitly indicated at the time of declaration and cannot change.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>A <strong>memory address</strong>, which is the memory address, in the RAM of the computer, where the value is stored. We won&rsquo;t work directly with memory addresses in this course, but we may see them when using a visualizer or debugger to execute our programs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="other-features">Other Features</h2>
<p>Depending on the programming language, we could also specify for a variable:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Visibility</strong>. An area of visibility or purpose, which is where inside the program the variable is visible. In Python and Java, visibility can be specified at the global level, i.e. visible in all the program, or local, i.e. visible at the individual procedure level.</li>
<li>A <strong>lifetime</strong>. The lifetime of a variable is closely related to its visibility: when the program performs an instruction outside the purpose of the variable, i.e. outside the <strong>scope</strong> of a variable, the variable itself ends its life.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="variable-operations">Variable Operations</h2>
<p>A programming language allows to perform two basic operations with a variable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reading the value of a variable. This value can be used in expression allowing to relate variables by means of operators. The basic operators are:
<ol>
<li>Arithmetic operators: such as addition <code>+</code>, and subtraction <code>-</code>. They allow performing basic arithmetic operations with numbers.</li>
<li>Comparison operators: such as less than <code>&lt;</code>, and greater than <code>&gt;</code>. Usually, they allow to comparing two operands, each of which could be a variable. The result of the comparison is either the Boolean value <code>true</code> or the Boolean value  <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Logic operators: such as <code>and</code> , <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>. This operator allows us to relate logical conditions together to create more complex statements.</li>
<li>String operators: such union or concatenation of strings of characters. For example, we can use the plus symbol <code>+</code> to concatenate the strings &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; and the string &ldquo;world&rdquo; to produce the string &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo;.  These operators allow us to manipulate strings.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Writing or storing a value inside a variable. This can be performed by an assignment operation such as <code>a = b</code>.</li>
</ol>

</table>
<p>Notice that variables must be assigned a value when declared in pseudocode. By default, most programming languages automatically assign the value $0$ to a new integer variable, so we&rsquo;ll use that value in our pseudocode as well.</p>
<p>Likewise, variables in a flowchart are given a type, whereas variables in pseudocode are not. Instead, the data type of those variables can be inferred by the values stored in them.</p>
<h2 id="variables-in-python">Variables in Python</h2>
<p>Variables in Python are simply defined by giving them a value. The type of the variable in inferred from the data stored in it at any given time, and a variable&rsquo;s type may change throughout the program as different values are assigned to it.</p>
<p>To define a variable, we can simply use an assignment statement to give it a value:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">3.5</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="casting">Casting</h2>
<p>We can also convert, or <em>cast</em>, data between different types. When we do this, the results may vary a bit due to how computers store and calculate numbers. So, it is always best to fully test any code that casts data between data types to make sure it works as expected.</p>
<p>To cast, we can simply use the new type as a <em>function</em> and place the value to be converted in parentheses:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">1.5</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will convert the floating point value stored in <code>x</code> to an integer value stored in <code>y</code>.</p>

<h1 id="conditionals">Conditionals</h1>

<p>The conditional statement, also known as the <strong>If-Then</strong> statement, is used to control the program&rsquo;s flow by checking the value of a Boolean statement and determining if a block of code should be executed based on that value. This is the simplest conditional instruction. If the condition is true, the block enclosed within the statement is executed. If it is false, then the code in the block is skipped.</p>
<p>A more advanced conditional statement, the <strong>If-Then-Else</strong> or <strong>If-Else</strong> statement, includes two blocks. The first block will be executed if the Boolean statement is true. If the Boolean statement is false, then the second block of code will be executed instead.</p>
<p>Simple conditions are obtained by means of the relational operators, such as <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>==</code>, which allow you to compare two elements, such as two numbers, or a variable and a number, or two variables. Compound conditions are obtained by composing two or more simple conditions through the logical operators <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>.</p>

<p>Recall that the Boolean logic operators <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code> can be used to construct more complex Boolean logic statements.</p>
<h3 id="or">Or</h3>
<p>For example, consider the statement <code>x &lt;= 5</code>. This could be broken down into two statements, combined by the <code>or</code> operation: <code>x &lt; 5 or x == 5</code>. The table below, called a <em>truth table</em>, gives the result of the or operation based on the values of the two operands:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Operand 1</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Operand 2</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Operand 1 <strong>or</strong> Operand 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As shown above, the result of the or operation is <code>True</code> if at least one of the operands is <code>True</code>.</p>
<h3 id="and">And</h3>
<p>Likewise, to express the mathematical condition <code>3 &lt; a &lt; 5</code> we can use the logical operator <code>and</code> by dividing the mathematical condition into two logical conditions: <code>a &gt; 3 and a &lt; 5</code>. The table below gives the result of the and operation based on the values of the two operands:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Operand 1</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Operand 2</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Operand 1 <strong>or</strong> Operand 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As shown above, the result of the and operation is <code>True</code> if both of the operands are <code>True</code>.</p>
<h3 id="not">Not</h3>
<p>Finally, the <code>not</code> logical operator is used to reverse, or invert, the value of a Boolean statement. For example, we can express the logical statement <code>x &lt; 3</code> as <code>not (x &gt;= 3)</code>, using the not operator to invert the value of the statement. The table below gives the result of the not operation based on the value of its operand:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Operand</th>
<th style="text-align:center"><strong>not</strong> Operand</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">True</td>
<td style="text-align:center">False</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In propositional logic, the completeness theorem shows that all other logical operators can be obtained by appropriately combining the and, or and not operators. So, by just understanding these three operators, we can construct any other Boolean logic statement.</p>

<h2 id="conditionals-in-practice">Conditionals in Practice</h2>
<p>The mechanism for determining which block an <strong>If-Then-Else</strong> statement executes is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the initial condition is true, execute the instructions enclosed between if and else</li>
<li>If the initial condition is false, execute the instructions between the else and the end of the block</li>
</ol>
<p>To understand how a conditional statement works, let&rsquo;s look at this example of a simple <strong>If-Then-Else</strong> statement. Consider the following flowchart:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-aff81234696154f751601a3015623274" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="If-Then-Else Flowchart Block" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.x.5.conditional0.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-aff81234696154f751601a3015623274"><img alt="If-Then-Else Flowchart Block" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.x.5.conditional0.png"></a></p>
<p>In this case, if <code>a</code> is less than zero, the output message will be &ldquo;The value of a is less than zero&rdquo;. Otherwise, if a is not less than zero (that is, if a is greater than or equal to zero), the output message will be &ldquo;The value of a is greater than or equal to zero&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="nesting">Nesting</h2>
<p>We can also nest conditional statements together, making more complex programs.</p>
<p>Consider the following flowchart:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-45e80aee8ffc7e14a61d8b3006d06e1d" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="If-Then-Else Nested Flowchart Block" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/1/1.3.x.5.conditionalnest.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>In this case, if a is less than zero the output message will be &ldquo;The value of a is less than zero&rdquo;. Otherwise (that is, if a is not less than zero so if a is greater than or equal to zero) the block checks whether a is equal to zero; if so, the output message will be &ldquo;The value of a is equal to zero&rdquo;. Otherwise (that is, if the first condition is false, i.e. <code>a &gt;= 0</code> and the second condition is false, i.e. is nonzero; the two conditions must be both true as if they were bound by a logical and, and they are the same as the condition <code>a &gt; 0</code>) the output message will be &ldquo;The value of a is greater than zero&rdquo;.</p>

<h1 id="loops">Loops</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLPFAGYV1Kw">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Loops are another way we can control the flow of our program, this time by repeating steps based on a given criteria.  A computer is able to repeat the same instructions many times. There are several ways to tell a computer to repeat a sequence of instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat an infinite number of times, e.g. <code>while true</code>. This construct is useful in software applications such as servers that will offer a service. The service is supposed to be available forever.</li>
<li>Repeat a specific number of times, e.g. <code>Repeat 10 times</code> or <code>for i = 1 to 10</code>. This loop can be used when you know the number of repetitions. There are also loops that allow you to repeat as many times as there are elements of a collection, such as <code>for each item in list</code></li>
<li>Repeat according to a condition. The number of repetitions depends on the condition. Most programming languages support the <code>while</code> loop, which repeats while the condition is true.</li>
</ul>
<p>In repeat while loops, the number of repetitions depends on the occurrence of a condition: the cycle repeats if the condition is true. Loops can also be nested, just like conditional statements.</p>

Finally, notice that the <code>range()</code> function in Python does not include the second parameter in the output. So, to get the numbers $1$ through $10$, inclusive, we must use <code>range(1, 11)</code> in our code.</p>

<p>Arrays allow us to store multiple values in the same variable, using an <em>index</em> to determine which value we wish to store or retrieve from the array. We can think of arrays like a set of post office boxes. Each one has the same physical address, the post office, but within the post office we can find an individual box based on its own box number.</p>
<p>Some programming languages, such as Java, use arrays that are statically sized when they are first created, and those arrays cannot be resized later. In addition, many languages that require variables to be declared with a type only allow a single variable type to be stored in an array.</p>
<p>Other languages, such as Python, use <em>lists</em> in place of arrays. List can be resized, and in untyped languages such as Python they can store different data types within the same list.</p>

<h2 id="lists-in-python">Lists in Python</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review the syntax for working with lists in Python.</p>
<h3 id="list-creation">List Creation</h3>
<p>To define a list in Python, we can simply place values inside of a set of square brackets <code>[]</code>, separated by commas <code>,</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">arr2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mf">1.2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">3.4</span><span class="p">]</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can also create an empty list by simply omitting any items inside the square brackets</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">arr3</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="adding-items">Adding Items</h3>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve created a list in Python, we can add items to the end of the list using the <code>append()</code> method:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">arr4</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">arr4</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">arr4</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">arr4</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="accessing-list-elements">Accessing List Elements</h3>
<p>Once the list is created, we can access individual items in the list by placing the <em>index</em> in square brackets <code>[]</code> after the list&rsquo;s variable name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">arr</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">arr</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="multidimensional-list">Multidimensional List</h3>
<p>Python lists can also be created with multiple dimensions, simply by appending lists as elements in a base list.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">two_dim_arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">another_arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">]]</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>To access elements in a multidimensional list, simply include additional sets of square brackets containing an index <code>[]</code> for each dimenison:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">another_arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">]]</span>

<p>There are several operations that can be performed on lists in Python as well:</p>

<p>Finally, we can use a special form of loop, called a <strong>For Each</strong> loop, to iterate through items in a list in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">]</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once important thing to note is that lists accessed within a <strong>For Each</strong> loop are read only. So, we cannot change the values stored in the list using this loop, but we can access them. If we want to change them, we should use a standard <strong>For</strong> loop to iterate through the indices of the list:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">]</span>

<h1 id="variable-roles">Variable Roles</h1>

<p>Variables in our programs can be used in a variety of different roles. The simplest role for any variable is to store a value that does not change throughout the entire program. Most variables, however, fit into one of several roles throughout the program.</p>
<p>To help us understand these roles, let&rsquo;s review them in detail here. As we move forward in this course, we&rsquo;ll see many different data structures that use variables in these ways, so it helps to know each of them early on!</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur4m3QjbBHE">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Strings are another very important data type in programming. A <em>string</em> is simply a set of characters that represent text in our programs. We can then write programs that use and manipulate strings in a variety of ways, allowing us to easily work with textual data.</p>
<h2 id="strings-in-flowcharts--pseudocode">Strings in Flowcharts &amp; Pseudocode</h2>

<h2 id="strings-in-python">Strings in Python</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review the syntax for working with strings in Python.</p>
<h3 id="string-creation">String Creation</h3>
<p>Strings in Python are declared just like any other variable:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;abc123&#34;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that strings are enclosed in double quotations marks <code>&quot;</code>. Since Python does not have a data type for a single character, we can do the same for single character strings as well:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;a&#34;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>There are several special characters we can include in our strings. Here are a few of the more common ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\'</code> - Single Quotation Mark (usually not required)</li>
<li><code>\&quot;</code> - Double Quotation Mark</li>
<li><code>\n</code> - New Line</li>
<li><code>\t</code> - Tab</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="string-parsing">String Parsing</h3>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O-eLkzD50s">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Most of the time, we will need to be able to <em>parse</em> strings in order to read input from the user. This is easily done using Python. Let&rsquo;s refer to the skeleton code given in an exercise:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># Load required modules</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="c1"># -=-=-=-=- MORE CODE GOES HERE -=-=-=-=- </span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">)</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code will initialize a variable called <code>reader</code> to read input from the terminal, or <code>sys.stdin</code> in Python.</p>
<p>Once we have a reader initialized, we can read a line of data from the input as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">reader</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">()</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>If we know that line will contain a single item of a different data type, such as an integer, we can also convert that input using the appropriate method:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">reader</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">())</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, if we have read an entire string of input consisting of multiple parts, we can use the <code>split</code> method to split the string in to <em>tokens</em> that are separated by a special <em>delimiter</em>. When we do this, we&rsquo;ll have to use special methods to convert the strings to other primitive data types. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;This 1 is 2.0 true&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">parts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&#34; &#34;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">first</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">parts</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">second</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parts</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">third</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">parts</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">fourth</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parts</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">fifth</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parts</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">])</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we are able to split the first string variable into $5$ parts, each one separated by a space in the original string. Then, we can use methods such as <code>int()</code> to convert each individual string token into the desired data type.</p>
<h3 id="reading-input-in-a-loop">Reading Input in a Loop</h3>
<p>When reading an unknown number of lines of input, we can use a loop in Python such as the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">reader</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strip</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">line</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="k">break</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="c1"># parse the input</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will read input until either a blank line is received (usually via the terminal), or there is no more input available to read (from a file).</p>
<h3 id="string-operations">String Operations</h3>
<p>There are also several operations we can perform on strings in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">s1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;This&#34;</span>

<h3 id="string-formatting">String Formatting</h3>
<p>Strings can also be used to create formatted output in Python through the use of f-strings. Here&rsquo;s a short example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">sum</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">123</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Student&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">

<h1 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp9jbKRVqQI">YouTube Video</a>

<p>An <em>exception</em> is an error that a program encounters when it is running. While some errors cannot be dealt with directly by the program, many of these exceptions can be <em>caught</em> and <em>handled</em> directly in our programs.</p>
<h2 id="exceptions-in-flowcharts--pseudocode">Exceptions in Flowcharts &amp; Pseudocode</h2>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t really a standard way to display exceptions in flowcharts and pseudocode, but we can easily create a system that works well for our needs. Below are the flowchart blocks and pseudocode examples we&rsquo;ll use in this course to represent exceptions and exception handling:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s review the syntax for working with exceptions in Python.</p>
<h3 id="try-catch">Try-Catch</h3>
<p>In Python, we can use a <strong>Try-Except</strong> statement to detect and handle exceptions in our code:</p>

<p>If desired, we can also <em>raise</em> our own exceptions in Python:</p>

<h3 id="finally">Finally</h3>
<p>We can also add <strong>Else</strong> and <strong>Finally</strong> blocks at the end of each <strong>Try-Except</strong> block.  A <strong>Finally</strong> block will be executed whenever the control exits the <strong>Try-Except</strong> block, even through the use of a <code>return</code> statement to return from a method. The <strong>Else</strong> block will be executed if the entire <strong>Try-Except</strong> block completes without any exceptions being raised:</p>

<p>When working with resources such as files in Python, we can also use a <strong>With</strong> block to ensure that those resources are properly closed when we are done with them. In addition, a <strong>With</strong> block will automatically catch and suppress any exceptions that result from trying to close the resource after an exception has occurred, preventing us from being bombarded by unavoidable exceptions. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<h1 id="io">I/O</h1>

<p>One of the major features of a modern computer is the ability to store and retrieve data from the computer&rsquo;s <em>file system</em>. So, we need to be able to access the file system in our code in order to build useful programs. Thankfully, most modern programming languages include a way to do this.</p>
<h2 id="io-in-flowcharts--pseudocode">I/O in Flowcharts &amp; Pseudocode</h2>
<p>Most operations working with files in code take the form of method calls. So, we will primarily use the <strong>call</strong> block to represent operations on files:</p>

<h1 id="documentation">Documentation</h1>

<p>It is important both to easily grasp the design choice and the code structure of a project even long after it has been completed. The documentation process starts by commenting the code. Code comments are usually intended for software developers and aim at clarifying the code by giving details of how it works. They are usually performed using inline or multiple lines comments using the language syntax.</p>
<h2 id="single-line-comments">Single Line Comments</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen before, we can add single-line comments to our Python programs using a hash symbol <code>#</code> before a line in our source file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># this is a comment</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># this is also a comment</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">True</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="docstrings">Docstrings</h2>
<p>Finally, Python also includes a secondary type of comment that spans multiple lines, specifically for creating documentation. A docstring is usually the first line of text inside of a class or method definition, and is surrounded by three double quotes <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code> with one set of three on each end.</p>
<p>These comments are specifically designed to provide information about classes and methods in our code. Here&rsquo;s a quick example using a simple class:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">IntTuple</span><span class="p">:</span>

<h1 id="style">Style</h1>

<p>To make your code easier to read, many textbooks and companies use a <em>style guide</em> that defines some of the formating rules that you should follow in your source code. In Python, these rules are very important, as the structure of your code is defined by the layout. We&rsquo;ll learn more about that in a later module.</p>
<p>For this book, most of the examples will be presented using the guidelines in the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="external" target="_blank">Style Guide for Python</a>. However, by default Codio used to use 2 spaces for an indentation level instead of 4, so that is the format that will be used in some examples in this book.</p>
<p>Google also provides a comprehensive <a href="http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html" rel="external" target="_blank">style guide</a> that is recommended reading if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about how to format your source code.</p>

<p>Object-oriented programming uses the idea of objects and classes to provide many improvements over other programming paradigms. The key concept of object-oriented programming - encapsulation - allows our data and the operations that manipulate that data to be bundled together within a single object.</p>

<h1 id="functions">Functions</h1>

<p>Functions are small pieces of reusable code that allow you to divide complex programs into smaller subprograms. Ideally, functions perform a single task and return a single value. (It should be noted that some programming languages allow for <em>procedures</em>, which are similar to functions but return no values. Except for the return value, it is safe to group them with functions in our discussion below.)</p>
<p>Functions can be thought of as black boxes. When we talk about <em>black boxes</em> we mean that users cannot look inside the box to see how it actually works. A good example of a black box is a soda machine. We all use them and know how to operate them, but very few of actually know how they work inside. Nor do we really want to know. We are happy to simply use them machine and have it give a nice cold soda when we are thirst!</p>
<h2 id="calling-functions">Calling Functions</h2>
<p>To be able to reuse functions easily, it is important to define what a function does and how it should be called.</p>
<p>Before we can call a function, we must know the function&rsquo;s <em>signature</em>. A function&rsquo;s signature includes the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>The name of the function.</li>
<li>The parameters (data) that must be provided for the function to perform its task.</li>
<li>The type of result the function returns.</li>
</ol>
<p>While a signature will allow us to actually call the function in code. Of course to  use functions effectively, we must also know exactly what the function is supposed to do. We will talk more about how we do this in the next module on programming by contract. For now we can assume that we just have a good description of what the function does.</p>
<p>While we do <em>not</em> need to know exactly how a function actually performs its task, the <em>algorithm</em> used to implement the function is vitally important as well. We will spend a significant amount of time in this course designing such algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="executing-functions">Executing Functions</h2>
<p>The lifecycle of a function is as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>A program (or another function) <em>calls</em> the function.</li>
<li>The function <em>executes</em> until it is complete.</li>
<li>The function <em>returns</em> to the calling program.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the function is called, the <em>arguments</em>, or <em>actual parameters</em>, are copied to the function&rsquo;s <em>formal parameters</em> and program execution jumps from the &ldquo;call&rdquo; statement to the function. When the function finishes execution, execution resumes at the statement following the &ldquo;call&rdquo; statement.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-4bd68177040200c19d9aa5d168d09ed6" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Function Call Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/2/2.2.function1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-4bd68177040200c19d9aa5d168d09ed6"><img alt="Function Call Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/2/2.2.function1.png"></a></p>
<p>In general, parameters are passed to functions <em>by value</em>, which means that the value of the calling program&rsquo;s actual parameter is copied into the function&rsquo;s formal parameter. This allows the function to modify the value of the formal parameter without affecting the actual parameter in the calling program.</p>
<p>However, when passing complex data structures such as objects, the parameters are passed <em>by reference</em> instead of by value. In this case, a pointer to the parameter is passed instead of a copy of the parameter value. By passing a pointer to the parameter, this allows the function to actually make changes to the calling program&rsquo;s actual parameter.</p>

<h1 id="classes--objects">Classes &amp; Objects</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcBIBGdkNTs">YouTube Video</a>

<p>As you might guess from its name, object-oriented programming languages are made to create and manipulate entities called <em>objects</em>. But what exactly are these objects? Objects were created to help decompose large complex programs with a lot of complex data into manageable parts.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Object</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>An <strong>object</strong> is a programming entity that contains related data and behavior.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A good example of an object is dog. But not just any dog, or all dogs, but a specific dog. Each dog has specific characteristics that are captured as data such as their name, their height, their weight, their breed, their age, etc. We call these characteristics <em>attributes</em> and all dogs have the same type of attributes, although the values of those attributes may be unique.  And generally, all dogs exhibit the same behaviors, or <em>methods</em>. Almost all dogs can walk, run, bark, eat, etc.</p>
<p>So, how do we define the basic attributes and behaviors of a dog? We probably start with some kind of idea of what a dog is. How do we describe dogs in general. In object orientation we do that through classes.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Class</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>A <strong>class</strong> is a blueprint for an object.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>What do we use blueprints for? Well, when we are building a physical structure such as a home or office building, an architect first creates a blueprint that tells the builder what to build and how everything should fit together. That is essentially what a class does. A class describes the types of <em>attributes</em> and <em>methods</em> that an object of that class will have.</p>
<p>Then to create objects, we say we create an instance of a class by calling the class&rsquo;s <em>constructor</em> method, which creates an object instance in memory and makes sure it&rsquo;s attributes are properly created. Once the object has been created, the methods defined by the class can be used to manipulate the attributes and internal data of the object.</p>

<h1 id="information-hiding">Information Hiding</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prZ8vQbJQm0">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Two of the most powerful concepts in object orientation are encapsulation and information hiding.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Encapsulation</em> is capturing both data and behavior into a single object.</li>
<li><em>Information hiding</em> is restricting access to some of the data and behavior of an object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Encapsulation enables information hiding, and information hiding allows us to simplify the interface used to interact with an object. Instead of needing to know everything about a particular class of objects in order to use or interact with those objects. This will make our programs less complex and easier to implement and test. It also makes it easier for you to change the internal implementations of methods without affecting the rest of your program. As long as the method behaves in the same way (i.e., produces the same outputs given a given set of inputs), the rest of your program will not be affected. Thus, we see two key parts of any class:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>interface</strong> to the class. Those methods and attributes that can be seen and called by an external object.</li>
<li>The <strong>implementation</strong> of the class. The internal representation of the attributes and implementation of methods to achieve the desired behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-world-example">Real World Example</h2>
<p>Encapsulation and information hiding are actually all around us. Take for example, a soda vending machine. There are many internal parts to the machine. However, as a user, we care little about how the machine works or what it does inside. We need to simply know how to insert money or swipe our card and press a couple of buttons to get the soda we desire. If a repair is needed and an internal motor is replaced, we don&rsquo;t care whether they replaced the motor with the exact same type of motor or the new model. As long as we can still get our soda by manipulating the same payment mechanisms and buttons, we are happy. You and I care only about the interface to the machine, not the implementation hiding inside.</p>
<h2 id="private-and-public">Private and Public</h2>
<p>To implement information hiding in our classes, we use visibility. In general, attributes and methods can either be <em>public</em> or <em>private</em>. If we want and attribute or method to be part of the class interface, we define them as <em>public</em>. If we want to hide a attribute or method from external objects, we defined them as <em>private</em>. An external object may access public attributes and call public methods, which is similar to using the payment mechanism or the buttons on a soda machine. However, the internals of how the object works is hidden by <em>private</em> attributes and methods, which are equivalent to the internal workings of the soda machine.</p>
<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>
<p>To implement information hiding, we recommend that you declare all attributes of a class as private. Any attribute whose value should be able to be read or changed by an external object should create special &ldquo;getter&rdquo; and &ldquo;setter&rdquo; methods that access those private variables. This way, you can make changes to the implementation of the attributes without changing how it is accessed in the external object.</p>

<h2 id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</h2>
<p>Polymorphsim is a concept that describes the fact that similar objects tend to behave in similar ways, even if they are not exactly alike. For example, if we might have a set of shapes such as a square, a circle, and a rhombus. While each shape shares certain attributes like having an area and a perimeter. However, each shape is also unique and may have differing number of sides and angles between those sides, or in the case of a circle, a diameter. We describe this relationship by saying a circle (or rectangle, or rhombus) &ldquo;is a&rdquo; shape as shown in the figure below.</p>

<h2 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>
<p>Inheritance is a mechanism that captures polymorphism by allowing classes to <em>inherit</em> the methods and attributes from another class. The basic purpose of inheritance to to reuse code in a principled and organized manner. We generally call the inheriting class the <em>subclass</em> or <em>child class</em>, while the class it inherits from is called the <em>superclass</em> or <em>parent class</em>.</p>
<p>Basically, when class &lsquo;A&rsquo; inherits from class &lsquo;B&rsquo;, all the methods and attributes of class &lsquo;A&rsquo; are automatically copied to class &lsquo;B&rsquo;. Class &lsquo;B&rsquo; can then add additional methods or attributes to <em>extend</em> class &lsquo;A&rsquo;, or overwrite the implementations of methods  in class &lsquo;A&rsquo; to <em>specialize</em> it.</p>
<p>When programming, we use inheritance to implement polymorphism. In our shape example, we would have a generic (or <em>abstract</em>) Shape class, which is inherited by a set of more specific shape classes (or <em>specializations</em>) as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-cf64d8d545c6cffc7e1ce5cdd2f30abf" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Polymorphism Example" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/2/2.5.inheritance.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-cf64d8d545c6cffc7e1ce5cdd2f30abf"><img alt="Polymorphism Example" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/2/2.5.inheritance.png"></a></p>
<p>In this example, the Shape class defines the &lsquo;color&rsquo; attribute and the &lsquo;getArea&rsquo; and &lsquo;getCircumference&rsquo; methods, which are inherited by the Rectangle, Circle, and Rhombus classes. Each of the subclasses define additional attributes that are unique to the definition of each shape type.</p>
<p>Notice that although the Shape class defines the signatures for the &lsquo;getArea&rsquo; and &lsquo;getCircumference&rsquo; methods, it cannot define the implementation of the methods, since this is unique to each subclass shape. Thus, each subclass shape will specialize the Shape class by implementing their own &lsquo;getArea&rsquo; and &lsquo;getCircumference&rsquo; methods.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-inheritance">Multiple Inheritance</h2>
<p>So far, we have discussed <em>Single inheritance</em>, which occurs when a class has only one superclass. However, theoretically, a class may inherit from more than one superclass, which is termed <em>multiple inheritance</em>. While a powerful mechanism, multiple inheritance also introduces complexity into understanding and implementing programs. And, there is always the possibility that attributes and methods from the various superclasses contradict each other in the subclass.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNHRPclA0DI">YouTube Video</a>

<p>For object <code>a</code> to be able to call a method in object <code>b</code>, object <code>a</code> must have a reference (a pointer, or the address of) object <code>b</code>. In many cases, objects <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> will be in a long-term relationship so that one or both objects will need to store the reference to the other in an attribute. When an object holds a reference to another object in an attribute, we call this a <em>link</em>. Examples of such relationships include a driver owning a car, a person living at an address, or a worker being employed by a company.</p>
<p>As we discussed earlier, objects are instances of classes. To represent this in a UML class diagram, we use the notion of an <em>association</em>, which is shown as a line connecting to two classes. More precisely, a link is an instance of an association. The figure belows shows three examples of an association between class <code>A</code> and class <code>B</code>.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-eebb642f1a6aabd8e7fc8398c9e41136" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Associations in UML" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/2/2.6.associations.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-eebb642f1a6aabd8e7fc8398c9e41136"><img alt="Associations in UML" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/2/2.6.associations.png"></a></p>
<p>The top example shows the basic layout of an association in UML. The line between the two classes denotes the association itself. The diagram specifies that <code>ClassA</code> is <em>associated with</em> <code>ClassB</code> and vice versa. We can name the association as well as place multiplicities on the relationships. The multiplicities show exactly how many links an object of one class must have to objects of the associated class. The general form a multiplicity is <code>n .. m</code>, which means that an object must store at least <code>n</code>, but no more than <code>m</code> references to other objects of the associated class; if only one number is given such as <code>n</code>, then the object must store exactly <code>n</code> references to objects in the associated class.</p>
<p>There are two basic types of associations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-way - both classes store references to the other class.</li>
<li>One-way -  only one class stores a reference to its associated class.</li>
</ul>
<p>The middle example shows a two-way association between <code>ClassA</code> and <code>ClassB</code>. Furthermore, each object of <code>ClassA</code> must have a link to exactly three objects of <code>ClassB</code>, while each <code>ClassB</code> object must have a link with exactly one <code>ClassA</code> object. (Note that the multiplicity that constrains <code>ClassA</code> is located next to <code>ClassB</code>, while the multiplicity that constrains <code>ClassB</code> is located next to <code>ClassA</code>.)</p>
<p>The bottom example shows a one-way association between <code>ClassA</code> and <code>ClassB</code>. In this case, <code>ClassA</code> must have links to either zero or one objects of <code>ClassB</code>. Since it is a one-way association, <code>ClassB</code> will have no links to objects of <code>ClassA</code>.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LOXCJZAS40">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In Python, we can break our programs up into individual <em>functions</em>, which are individual routines that we can call in our code. Let&rsquo;s review how to create functions in Python.</p>

<h3 id="declaring-functions">Declaring Functions</h3>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNKPa8fLz9E">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In general, a function definition in Python needs a few elements. Let&rsquo;s start at the simplest case:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&#34;Foo&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="k">return</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s break this example function definition down to see how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we use the keyword <code>def</code> at the beginning of this function definition. That keyword tells Python that we&rsquo;d like to <em>define</em> a new function. We&rsquo;ll need to include it at the beginning of each function definition.</li>
<li>Next, we have the name of the function, <code>foo</code>. We can name a function using any valid identifier in Python. In general, function names in Python always start with a lowercase letter, and use underscores between the words in the function name if it contains multiple words.</li>
<li>Following the function name, we see a set of parentheses <code>()</code> that list the parameters for this function. Since there is nothing included in this example, the function <code>foo</code> does not require any parameters.</li>
<li>Finally, we see a colon <code>:</code> indicating that the indented block of code below this definition is contained within the function. In this case, the function will simply print <code>Foo</code> to the terminal.</li>
<li>The function ends with the <code>return</code> keyword. Since we aren&rsquo;t returning a value, we aren&rsquo;t required to include a <code>return</code> keyword in the function. However, it is helpful to know that we may use that keyword to exit the function at any time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once that function is created, we can call it using the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">()</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="parameters-and-return">Parameters and Return</h3>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imqklu8DFR8">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In a more complex case, we can declare a function that accepts parameters and returns a value, as in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">count_letters</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">letter</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">)):</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">letter</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">      <span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">output</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the function accepts two parameters: <code>input</code>, which could be a string, and <code>letter</code>, which could be a single character. However, since Python does not enforce a type on these parameters, they could actually be any value. We could add additional code to this function that checks the type of each parameter and raises a <code>TypeError</code> if they are not the expected type.</p>
<p>We can use the parameters just like any other variable in our code. To return a value, we use the <code>return</code> keyword, followed by the value or variable containing the value we&rsquo;d like to return.</p>
<p>To call a function that requires parameters, we can include values as <em>arguments</em> in the parentheses of the function call:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">sum</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">count_letters</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&#34;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&#34;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&#34;e&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
            <footer class="footline">
              
              
              
              
            </footer>
          </article>

<h1 id="overloading">Overloading</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOtnZGIqsaQ">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Python allows us to specify default values for parameters in a function definition. In that way, if those parameters are not provided, the default value will be used instead. So, it may appear that there are multiple functions with the same name that accept a different number of parameters. This is called <em>function overloading</em>.</p>
<h2 id="function-overloading-using-default-values">Function Overloading using Default Values</h2>
<p>For example, we could create a function named <code>max()</code> that could take either two or three parameters:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="nb">max</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we are calling <code>max()</code> with both 2 and 3 arguments from <code>main()</code>. When we only provide 2 arguments, the third parameter will be given the default value <code>None</code>, which is a special value in Python showing that the variable is empty. Then, we can use <code>if z is not None</code> as part of an <strong>If-Then</strong> statement to see if we need to take that variable into account in our code.</p>
<p>This example also introduces a new keyword, <code>is</code>. The <code>is</code> keyword in Python is used to determine if two variables are exactly the same object, not just the same value. In this case, we want to check that <code>z</code> is exactly the same object as <code>None</code>, not just that it has the same value. In Python, it is common to use the <code>is</code> keyword when checking to see if an optional parameter is given the value <code>None</code>. We&rsquo;ll see this keyword again in a later chapter as we start dealing with objects.</p>
<h2 id="keyword-arguments">Keyword Arguments</h2>
<p>Python also allows us to specify function arguments using keywords that match the name of the parameter in the function. In that way, we can specify the arguments we need, and the function can use default values for any unspecified parameters. Here&rsquo;s a quick example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">      
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># main guard</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the <code>args()</code> method has one required parameter, <code>a</code>. It can either be provided as the first argument, known as a <em>positional argument</em>, or as a <em>keyword argument</em> like <code>a=2</code>. The other parameters, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>, can either be provided as <em>positional arguments</em> or <em>keyword arguments</em>, but they are not required since they have default values.</p>
<p>Also, we can see that when we use keyword arguments we do not have to provide the arguments in the order they are defined in the function&rsquo;s definition. However, any arguments provided without keywords must be placed at the beginning of the function call, and will be matched positionally with the first parameters defined in the function.</p>
<h2 id="variable-length-parameters">Variable Length Parameters</h2>
<p>Finally, Python allows us to define a single parameter that is a <em>variable length parameter</em>. In essence, it will allow us to accept anywhere from 0 to many arguments for that single parameter, which will then be stored in a list. Let&rsquo;s look at an example:</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhLq9_iUZ3k">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In programming, a <em>class</em> describes an individual entity or part of the program. In many cases, the <em>class</em> can be used to describe an actual thing, such as a person, a vehicle, or a game board, or a more abstract thing such as a set of rules for a game, or even an artificial intelligence engine for making business decisions.</p>
<p>In <em>object-oriented programming</em>, a class is the basic building block of a larger program. Typically each part of the program is contained within a class, representing either the main logic of the program or the individual entities or <em>things</em> that the program will use.</p>
<h2 id="representing-classes-in-uml">Representing Classes in UML</h2>
<p>We can represent the contents of a class in a UML Class Diagram. Below is an example of a class called <code>Person</code>:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-9ddb1b9631666cbcd32a394eb8b1e134" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Person UML Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/2/2.17.p.4.personuml.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Throughout the next few pages, we will realize the design of this class in code.</p>
<h2 id="creating-classes-in-python">Creating Classes in Python</h2>
<p>To create a class in Python, we can simply use the <code>class</code> keyword at the beginning of our file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="k">pass</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we&rsquo;ve already learned, each class declaration in Python includes these parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>class</code> - this keyword says that we are declaring a new class.</li>
<li><code>Person</code> - this is an identifier that gives us the name of the class we are declaring.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following the declaration, we see a colon <code>:</code> marking the start of a new block, inside of which will be all of the <em>fields</em> and <em>methods</em> stored in this class. We&rsquo;ll need to indent all items inside of this class, just like we do with other blocks in Python.</p>
<p>In order for Python to allow this code to run, we cannot have an empty block inside of a class declaration. So, we can add the keyword <code>pass</code> to the block inside of the class so that it is not empty.</p>
<p>By convention, we would typically store this class in a file called <code>Person.py</code>.</p>

<h1 id="attributes">Attributes</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZX2RBcsRfc">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Of course, our classes are not very useful at this point because they don&rsquo;t include any attributes or methods. Including attributes in a class is one of the simplest uses of classes, so let&rsquo;s start there.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-c56d6c7e99b3c903dbdeccc243d7d009" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Person UML Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/2/2.17.p.4.personuml.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<h2 id="adding-attributes">Adding Attributes</h2>
<p>To add an attribute to a class, we can simply declare a variable inside of our class declaration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">last_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Person&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">first_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Test&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">age</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">25</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s really all there is to it! These are <em>static attributes</em> or <em>class attributes</em> that are shared among all instances of the class. On the next page, we&rsquo;ll see how we can create <em>instance attributes</em> within the class&rsquo;s constructor.</p>
<p>Finally, we can make these attributes private by adding two underscores to the variable&rsquo;s name. We denote this on our UML diagram by placing a minus <code>-</code> before the attribute or method&rsquo;s name. Otherwise, a <code>+</code> indicates that it should be public. In the diagram above, each attribute is private, so we&rsquo;ll do that in our code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">__last_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Person&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">__first_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Test&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">__age</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">25</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately, Python does have a way to get around these restrictions as well. Instead of referencing <code>__last_name</code>, we can instead reference <code>_Person__last_name</code> to find that value, as in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">ellie</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&#34;Jonson&#34;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Ellie&#34;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">29</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">ellie</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_Person__last_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Jameson&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ellie</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">last_name</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Jameson</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Behind the scenes, Python adds an underscore <code>_</code> followed by the name of the class to the beginning of any class attribute or method that is prefixed with two underscores <code>__</code>. So, knowing that, we can still access those attributes and methods if we want to. Thankfully, it&rsquo;d be hard to do this accidentally, so it provides some small level of security for our data.</p>

<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd5sEy9Svsc">YouTube Video</a>

<p>We can also add methods to our classes. These methods are used either to modify the attributes of the class or to perform actions based on the attributes stored in the class. Finally, we can even use those methods to perform actions on data provided as arguments. In essence, the sky is the limit with methods in classes, so we&rsquo;ll be able to do just about anything we need to do in these methods. Let&rsquo;s see how we can add methods to our classes.</p>

<h2 id="constructors">Constructors</h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck_uPDPhaV8">YouTube Video</a>

<p>A <em>constructor</em> is a special method that is called whenever a new instance of a class is created. It is used to set the initial values of attributes in the class. We can even accept parameters as part of a constructor, and then use those parameters to populate attributes in the class.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the <code>Person</code> class example we&rsquo;ve been working on and add a simple constructor to that class:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">__last_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Person&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">__first_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Test&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">__age</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">25</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">last_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">first_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">age</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__last_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">last_name</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__first_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">first_name</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__age</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">age</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since the constructor is an instance method, we need to add a parameter to the function at the very beginning of our list of parameters, typically named <code>self</code>. This parameter is automatically added by Python whenever we call an instance method, and it is a reference to the current <em>instance</em> on which the method is being called. We&rsquo;ll learn more about this later.</p>
<p>Inside that constructor, notice that we use each parameter to set the corresponding attribute, using the <code>self</code> keyword once again to refer to the current object.</p>
<p>Also, since we are now defining the attributes as <em>instance attributes</em> in the constructor, we can remove them from the class definition itself:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span><span class="p">:</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__first_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">first_name</span>

<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Variable Scope</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>We&rsquo;ve already discussed variable scope earlier in this course. Recall that two different functions may use the same local variable names without affecting each other because they are in different scopes.</p>
<p>The same applies to classes. A class may have an attribute named <code>age</code>, but a method inside of the class may also use a local variable named <code>age</code>. Therefore, we must be careful to make sure that we access the correct variable,  using the <code>self</code> reference if we intend to access the attribute&rsquo;s value in the current instance. Here&rsquo;s a short example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Test</span><span class="p">:</span>

However, in the method <code>bar()</code> we see that <code>age</code> itself causes a <code>NameError</code> since there is no other variable named <code>age</code> defined in that scope. We have to use <code>self.age</code> to reference the attribute.</p>
<p>So, we should always get in the habit of using <code>self</code> to refer to any attributes, just to avoid any unintended problems later on.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwnD-Ih2yWs">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In Python, we can use a special decorator <code>@property</code> to define special methods, called <em>getters</em> and <em>setters</em>, that can be used to access and update the value of private attributes.</p>
<h3 id="getter">Getter</h3>
<p>In Python, a <em>getter</em> method is a method that can be used to access the value of a private attribute. To mark a getter method, we use the <code>@property</code> decorator, as in the following example:</p>

<p>We can also build classes that <em>inherit</em> attributes and methods from another class. This allows us to build more complex structures in our code, better representing the relationships between real world objects.</p>
<h2 id="inheritance-in-uml">Inheritance in UML</h2>
<p>As we learned earlier in this chapter, we can represent an inheritance relationship with an open arrow in our UML diagrams, as shown below:</p>

<p>In this diagram, the <code>Student</code> class inherits from, or is a subclass of, the <code>Person</code> class.</p>
<h2 id="inheritance-in-python">Inheritance in Python</h2>

<p>Since the subclass <code>Student</code> also includes a definition for the method <code>happy_birthday()</code>, we say that that method has been <em>overridden</em> in the subclass. We can do this by simply creating the new method in the <code>Student</code> class, making sure it accepts the same number of parameters as the original:</p>

<p>In addition to private and public attributes and methods, UML also includes the concept of <em>protected</em> methods. This modifier is used to indicate that the attribute or method should not be accessed outside of the class, but will allow any subclasses to access them. Python does not enforce this restriction; it is simply convention. In a UML diagram, the protected keyword is denoted by a hash symbol <code>#</code> in front of the attribute or method. In Python, we then prefix those attributes or methods with a single underscore <code>_</code>.</p>
<h2 id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InU9BRjjKsg">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Inheritance allows us to make use of <em>polymorphism</em> in our code. Loosely polymorphism allows us to treat an instance of a class within the data type of any of its parent classes. By doing so, we can only access the methods and attributes defined by the data type, but any overriden methods will use the implementation from the child class.</p>

<h2 id="static">Static</h2>
<p>Many programming languages include a special keyword <code>static</code>. In essence, a <code>static</code> attribute or method is part of the class in which it is declared instead of part of objects instantiated from that class. If we think about it, the word <em>static</em> means &ldquo;lacking in change&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s sort of a good way to think about it.</p>
<p>In a UML diagram, static attributes and methods are denoted by underlining them.</p>
<h3 id="static-attributes">Static Attributes</h3>

<p>In Python, any attributes declared outside of a method are <em>class attributes</em>, but they can be considered the same as <em>static attributes</em> until they are overwritten by an instance. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Stat</span><span class="p">:</span>

Here&rsquo;s a <code>main()</code> method that will help us explore how the static keyword operates:</p>

Interestingly, since the attribute <code>x</code> is static, we can access it directly from the class <code>Stat</code>, without even having to instantiate an object. So, we can update the value in that way to 25, and it will take effect in any objects instantiated from <code>Stat</code>.</p>
<p>Below that, we can update the value of <code>x</code> attached to <code>some_stat</code> to 10, and we&rsquo;ll see that it now creates an <em>instance attribute</em> for that object that contains 10, overwriting the previous <em>class attribute</em>. The value attached to <code>another_stat</code> is unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="static-methods">Static Methods</h3>
<p>Python also allows us to create <em>static methods</em> that work in a similar way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Stat</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span>     <span class="c1"># class or static attribute</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">an_y</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">an_y</span> <span class="c1"># instance attribute</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="nd">@staticmethod</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Stat</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">a</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>We have now added a static method <code>sum()</code> to our <code>Stat</code> class. To create a static method, we place the <code>@staticmethod</code> <em>decorator</em> above the method declaration. We haven&rsquo;t learned about decorators yet, but they allow us to tell Python some important information about the code below the decorator.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to remember that a static method cannot access any non-static attributes or methods, since it doesn&rsquo;t have access to an instantiated object in the <code>self</code> parameter.</p>
<p>As a tradeoff, we can call a static method without instantiating the class either, as in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">Stat</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>

Since we aren&rsquo;t instantiating our <code>Main</code> class, we can use the decorator <code>@staticmethod</code> above the method to clearly mark that it should be considered a static method.</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X21IFfio_h0">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Another major feature of class inheritance is the ability to define a method in a parent class, but not provide any code that implements that function. In effect, we are saying that all objects of that type must include that method, but it is up to the child classes to provide the code. These methods are called <em>abstract</em> methods, and the classes that contain them are <em>abstract</em> classes. Let&rsquo;s look at how they work!</p>

<h3 id="abstract-in-python">Abstract in Python</h3>
<p>In the UML diagram above, we see that the <code>describe()</code> method in the <code>Vehicle</code> class is printed in italics. That means that the method should be abstract, without any code provided. To do this in Python, we simply inherit from a special class called <code>ABC</code>, short for &ldquo;Abstract Base Class,&rdquo; and then use the <code>@abstractmethod</code> decorator:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">abc</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">ABC</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">abstractmethod</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="k">pass</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that we must first import both the <code>ABC</code> class and the <code>@abstractmethod</code> decorator from a library helpfully called <code>ABC</code>. Then, we can use <code>ABC</code> as the parent class of our class, and update each method using the <code>@abstractmethod</code> decorator before the method, similar to how we&rsquo;ve already used <code>@staticmethod</code> in an earlier module.</p>
<p>In addition, since we have declared the method <code>describe()</code> to be abstract, we can either add some code to that method that can be called using <code>super().describe()</code> from a child class, or we can simply choose to use the <code>pass</code> keyword to avoid including any code in the method.</p>
<p>Now, any class that inherits from the <code>Vehicle</code> class must provide an implementation for the <code>describe()</code> method. If it does not, that class must also be declared to be abstract. So, for example, in the UML diagram above, we see that the <code>MotorVehicle</code> class does not include an implementation for <code>describe()</code>, so we&rsquo;ll also have to make it abstract.</p>
<p>Of course, that means that we&rsquo;ll have to inherit from both <code>Vehicle</code> and <code>ABC</code>. In Python, we can do that by simply including both classes in parentheses after the subclass name, separated by a comma.</p>

<h1 id="data-structures">Data Structures</h1>

<p>One way to look at a computer program is to think of it as a list of instructions that the computer should follow. However, in another sense, many computer programs are simply ways to manipulate data to achieve a desired result. We&rsquo;ve already written many programs that do this, from calculating the minimum and maximum values of a list of numbers, to storing and retrieving data about students and teachers in a school.</p>
<p>As we start to consider our programs as simply ways to manipulate data, we may quickly realize that we are performing the same actions over and over again, or even treating data in many similar ways. Over time, these ideas have become the basis for several common <em>data structures</em> that we may use in our programs.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-0603eb84b53634965d47d9f87844d130" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Tree Graphic" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.1.tree_wiki.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<h2 id="data-structure">Data Structure</h2>
<p>Broadly speaking, a <em>data structure</em> is any part of our program that stores data using a particular format or method. Typically data structures define how the data is arranged, how it is added to the structure, how it can be removed, and how it can be accessed.</p>
<p>Data structures can give us very useful ways to look at how our data is organized. In addition, a data structure may greatly impact how easy, or difficult, it can be to perform certain actions with the data. Finally, data structures also impose performance limitations on our code. Some structures may be better at performing a particular operation than others, so we may have to consider that as well when choosing a data structure for our program.</p>
<p>In this class, we&rsquo;ll spend the majority of our time learning about these common data structures, as well as <em>algorithmic techniques</em> that work well with each one. By formalizing these structures and techniques, we are able to build a common set of building blocks that every programmer is familiar with, making it much easier to build programs that others can understand and reuse.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s review some of these common data structures and see how they could be useful in our programs.</p>

<p>A <em>linear</em> data structure typically stores data in a single dimension, just like an array. By using a linear data structure, we would know that a particular element in the data structure comes before another element or vice-versa, but that&rsquo;s about it. A great example is seen in the image above. We have a list of numbers, and each element in the list comes before another element, as indicated by the arrows.</p>

<p>Linear data structures can further be divided into two types: arrays, which are typically finite sized; and linked lists, which can be infinitely sized. We&rsquo;ve already worked with arrays extensively by this point, but linked lists are most likely a new concept. That&rsquo;s fine! We&rsquo;ll explore how to build our own later in this course.</p>
<p>Using either arrays or linked lists, we can build the three most commonly used linear data structures: <em>stacks</em>, <em>queues</em>, and <em>sets</em>. However, before we learn about each of those, let&rsquo;s review a bit more about what the <em>list</em> data structure itself looks like.</p>

<h1 id="lists">Lists</h1>

<p>The <em>list</em> data structure is the simplest form of a linear data structure. As we can guess from the definition, a list is simply a grouping of data that is presented in a given order. With lists, not only do the elements in the list matter, but the order matters as well. It&rsquo;s not simply enough to state that elements $8$, $6$ and $7$ are in the list, but generally we also know that $8$ comes before $6$, which comes before $7$.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already learned about arrays, which are perfect examples of lists in programming. In fact, Python uses the data type <code>list</code> in the same way most other programming languages use arrays. Other programming languages, such as Java, provide a <code>list</code> data structure through their standard libraries.</p>
<h2 id="list-operations">List Operations</h2>
<p>One important way to classify data structures is by the operations they can perform on the data. Since a list is the simplest version of a linear data structure, it has several important operations it can perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>insert</strong> - inserts an element anywhere in the list, including at the beginning or the end;</li>
<li><strong>remove</strong> - removes an element from anywhere in the list, including at the beginning or the end;</li>
<li><strong>find</strong> - finds the location of the given element in the list, usually given as an <em>index</em> just like an array index;</li>
<li><strong>get</strong> - returns the element at a given location, similar to using an array index to retrieve an element from an array; and</li>
<li><strong>size</strong> - returns the number of elements in the list.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s look at the <strong>insert</strong> operation. Assume we have the list shown in the following diagram:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-f96ae53de83e4cfba2c2b174bb4cece4" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="List Data Structure" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.2.list.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-f96ae53de83e4cfba2c2b174bb4cece4"><img alt="List Data Structure" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.2.list.png"></a></p>
<p>Then, we decide we&rsquo;d like to add the element $4$ at index $3$ in this list. So, we can think of this like trying to place the element in the list as shown below:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-ebc04c48315768d79676d3445291dd82" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="List Before Insert" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.3.before.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-ebc04c48315768d79676d3445291dd82"><img alt="List Before Insert" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.3.before.png"></a></p>
<p>Once we insert that element, we then shift all of the other elements back one position, making the list one element larger. The final version is shown below:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-427b615cf89c7a52e494c1b8c87f53ca" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="List After Insert" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.3.after.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-427b615cf89c7a52e494c1b8c87f53ca"><img alt="List After Insert" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.3.after.png"></a></p>
<p>Lists are a very powerful data structure, and one of the most commonly used in a variety of programs. While arrays may seem very flexible, their static size and limited operations can sometimes make them more difficult to use than they are worth. Many programmers choose to use the more flexible list data structure instead.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-a-list">When to Use a List</h2>
<p>When deciding which data structure to use, lists are best when we might be adding or removing data from anywhere in the list, but we want to maintain the ordering between elements. As we&rsquo;ll see on the later pages, we can have more specific types of structures for particular ways we intend to add and remove data from our structure, but lists are a great choice if neither of those are a good fit.</p>

<h1 id="stacks-and-queues">Stacks and Queues</h1>

<p>The next two data structures we&rsquo;ll look at are <em>stacks</em> and <em>queues</em>. They are both very similar to lists in most respects, but each one puts a specific limitation on how the data structure operates that make them very useful in certain situations.</p>
<h2 id="stack">Stack</h2>
<p><a href="#R-image-5b3a794e115d7b8b831760789c4cd581" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Stack Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.4.stack_wiki.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-5b3a794e115d7b8b831760789c4cd581"><img alt="Stack Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.4.stack_wiki.png"></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A <em>stack</em> is one special version of a list. Specifically, a stack is a <strong>Last In, First Out</strong> or <strong>LIFO</strong> data structure.</p>
<p>So, what does that mean? Basically, we can only add elements to the end, or <em>top</em> of the stack. Then, when we want to get an element from the stack, we can only take the one from the top&ndash;the one that was most recently added.</p>
<p>A great way to think of a stack is like a stack of plates, such as the one pictured below:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-af26a6b6b2d895e8992d312e45b0f5fc" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Stack of Plates" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.4.plates_wiki.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-af26a6b6b2d895e8992d312e45b0f5fc"><img alt="Stack of Plates" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.4.plates_wiki.jpg"></a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>When we want to add a new plate to the stack, we can just set it on top. Likewise, if we need a plate, we&rsquo;ll just take the top one off and use it.</p>
<p>A stack supports three major unique operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>push</strong> - add an item to the top of the stack;</li>
<li><strong>pop</strong> - remove an item from the top of the stack; and</li>
<li><strong>peek</strong> - see what the top item on the stack is, but don&rsquo;t remove it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many stacks also include additional operations such as <strong>size</strong> and <strong>find</strong> as well.</p>
<h2 id="queue">Queue</h2>
<p><a href="#R-image-9fd8896e64f4bf90783356ab51155dbe" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Queue Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.4.queue_wiki.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-9fd8896e64f4bf90783356ab51155dbe"><img alt="Queue Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.4.queue_wiki.svg"></a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>A <em>queue</em> is another special version of a list, this time representing a <strong>First In, First Out</strong> or <strong>FIFO</strong> data structure.</p>
<p>As seen in the diagram above, new items are added to the <em>back</em> of the queue. But, when we need to take an item from a queue, we&rsquo;ll take the item that is in the <em>front</em>, which is the one that was added first.</p>
<p>Where have we seen this before? A great example is waiting our turn in line at the train station,</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-8b745d1a8973edfa3153d166a80846fc" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Waiting in Line" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.4.line_wiki.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-8b745d1a8973edfa3153d166a80846fc"><img alt="Waiting in Line" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.4.line_wiki.jpg"></a><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In many parts of the world, the term <em>queueing</em> is commonly used to refer to the act of standing in line. So, it makes perfect sense to use that same word to refer to a data structure.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-a-stack-or-a-queue">When to Use a Stack or a Queue</h2>
<p>As we can probably guess, we would definitely want to use a stack if we need our data structure to follow the last in, first out, or LIFO ordering. Similarly, we&rsquo;d use a queue if we need first in, first out or FIFO ordering.</p>
<p>If we can&rsquo;t be sure that one or the other of those orderings will work for us, then we can&rsquo;t really use a stack or a queue in our program.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-just-use-lists">Why Not Just Use Lists?</h2>
<p>Of course, one of the biggest questions that comes from this is &ldquo;why not just use lists for everything?&rdquo; Indeed, lists can be used as both a queue and a stack, simply by consistently inserting and removing elements from either the beginning or the end of the list as needed. So why do we need to have separate data structures for a queue and a stack?</p>
<p>There are two important reasons. First, if we know that we only need to access the most recently added element, or the element added first, it makes sense to have a special data structure for just that usage. In this way, it is clear to anyone else reading our program that we will only be using the data in that specific way. Behind the scenes, of course, we can just use a list to represent a queue or a stack, but in our design documents and in our code, it might be very helpful to know if we should think of it like a stack or a queue.</p>
<p>The other reason has to do with performance. By knowing exactly how we need to use the data, we can design data structures that are specifically created to perform certain operations very quickly and efficiently. A generic list data structure may not be as fast or memory efficient as a structure specifically designed to be used as a stack, for example.</p>
<p>As we learn about each of these data structures throughout this course, we&rsquo;ll explore how each data structure works in terms of runtime performance and memory efficiency.</p>

<h1 id="sets">Sets</h1>

<p><a href="#R-image-34339403405ead777028f84d97aea2df" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Set Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.5.set.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-34339403405ead777028f84d97aea2df"><img alt="Set Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.5.set.png"></a></p>
<p>Another linear data structure is known as a <em>set</em>. A <em>set</em> is very similar to a list, but with two major differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>A set cannot contain duplicate elements. Each element must be unique in the set.</li>
<li>A set does not necessarily keep track of the ordering of the elements within the set.</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, the term <em>set</em> comes from mathematics. We&rsquo;ve probably seen sets already in a math class.</p>
<p>Beyond the typical operations to add and remove elements from a set, there are several operations unique to sets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>union</strong> - find the elements that are contained in one or both of the sets given;</li>
<li><strong>intersection</strong> - find the elements only contained in both sets given;</li>
<li><strong>set difference</strong> - remove all elements from a set that are also contained in another set; and</li>
<li><strong>subset</strong> - test if all elements in one set are also contained in another set.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, many of these operations may be familiar from their use in various math classes.</p>
<h2 id="set-operations-and-boolean-logic">Set Operations and Boolean Logic</h2>
<p>In addition, we can easily think of set operations as boolean logic operators. For example, the set operation <strong>union</strong> is very similar to the boolean operator <strong>or</strong>, as seen in the diagram below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-b34061be314a319c3372413c4394f672" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Set Union" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.5.union.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-b34061be314a319c3372413c4394f672"><img alt="Set Union" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.5.union.svg"></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>As long as an item is contained in one set <em>or</em> the other, it is included in the union of the sets.</p>
<p>Similarly, the same comparison works for the set operation <strong>intersection</strong> and the boolean <strong>and</strong> operator.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-71dc1c847bcecfe5b14b2bc044bf754f" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Set Intersection" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.5.intersect.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Once again, if an item is contained in the first set <em>and</em> the second set, it is contained in the intersection of those sets.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-a-set">When to Use a Set</h2>
<p>A set is a great choice when we know that our program should prevent duplicate items from being added to a data structure. Likewise, if we know we&rsquo;ll be using some of the specific operations that are unique to sets, then a set is an excellent choice.</p>
<p>Of course, if we aren&rsquo;t sure that our data structure will only store unique items, we won&rsquo;t be able to use a set.</p>

<p>The last of the linear data structures may seem linear from the outside, but inside it can be quite a bit more complex.</p>
<p>The <em>map</em> data structure is an example of a <em>key-value</em> data structure, also known as a <em>dictionary</em> or <em>associative array</em>. In the simplest case, a map data structure keeps track of a <em>key</em> that uniquely identifies a particular <em>value</em>, and stores that value along with the <em>key</em> in the data structure.</p>
<p>Then, to retrieve that <em>value</em>, the program must simply provide the same <em>key</em> that was used to store it.</p>
<p>In a way, this is very similar to how we use an array, since we provide an <em>array index</em> to store and retrieve items from an array. The only difference is that the key in a map can be any data type! So it is a much more powerful data structure.</p>
<p>In fact, this data structure is one of the key ideas behind modern databases, allowing us to store and retrieve database records based on a unique primary key attached to each row in the database.</p>
<h2 id="map-operations">Map Operations</h2>
<p>A map data structure should support the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>put</strong> - places a new value in the map using the given key,</li>
<li><strong>get</strong> - retrieves a value from the map using the given key,</li>
<li><strong>entries</strong> - gets all of the values in the map,</li>
<li><strong>keys</strong> - gets all of the keys in the map,</li>
<li><strong>containsKey</strong> - determines if the given key is in use in the map, and</li>
<li><strong>containsValue</strong> - determines if the given value is stored in the map.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later in this course, we&rsquo;ll devote an entire module to learning how to build our own map data structures and explore these operations in more detail.</p>

<p>One of the most common ways to implement the map data structure is through the use of a <em>hash table</em>. A hash table uses an array to store the <em>values</em> in the map, and uses a special function called a <em>hash function</em> to convert the given key to a simple number. This number represents the array index for the <em>value</em>. In that way, the same key will always find the value that was given.</p>
<p>But what if we have two keys that produce the same array index? In that case, we&rsquo;ll have to add some additional logic to our map to handle that situation.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-a-map">When to Use a Map</h2>
<p>Maps are great data structures when we need to store and retrieve data using a specific <em>key</em>. Just like we would store data in a database or put items in a numbered box to retrieve later, we can use a <em>map</em> as a general purpose storage and retrieval data structure.</p>
<p>Of course, if our data items don&rsquo;t have unique keys assigned to them, then using a map may not be the best choice of data structure. Likewise, if each key is a sequential integer, we may be able to use an array just as easily.</p>

<p>The other type of data structure we can use in our programs is the non-linear data structure.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, non-linear data structures allow us to store data across multiple dimensions, and there may be multiple <em>paths</em> through the data to get from one item to another. In fact, much of the information stored in the data structure has to do with the paths between elements more than the elements themselves.</p>

<p>Just like linear data structures, there are several different types of non-linear data structures. In this case, each one is a more specialized version of the previous one, hence the hierarchy shown above. On the next few pages, we&rsquo;ll explore each one just a bit to see what they look like.</p>

<p>The most general version of a non-linear data structure is the <em>graph</em>, as shown in the diagram above. A graph is a set of <em>nodes</em> that contain data, as well as a set of <em>edges</em> that link two nodes together. Edges themselves may also contain data.</p>
<p>Graphs are great for storing and visualizing not just data, but also the relationships between data. For example, each node in the graph could represent a city on the map, with the edges representing the travel time between the two cities. Or we could use the nodes in a graph to represent the people in a social network, and the edges represent connections or friendships between two people. There are many possibilities!</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-a-graph">When to Use a Graph</h2>
<p>Graphs are a great choice when we need to store data and relationships between the data, but we aren&rsquo;t sure exactly what structures or limitations are present in the data. Since a graph is the most general and flexible non-linear data type, it has the most ability to represent data in a wide variety of ways.</p>

<p>File:Tree (computer science).svg. (2019, October 20). Wikimedia Commons, the free media repository. Retrieved 03:13, February 8, 2020 from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Tree_(computer_science).svg&oldid=371240902" rel="external" target="_blank">https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Tree_(computer_science).svg&oldid=371240902</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>tree</em> is a more constrained version of a graph data structure. Specifically, a tree is a graph that can be shown as a hierarchical structure, where each node in the tree is itself the root of a smaller tree. Each node in the tree can have one or more child nodes and exactly one parent node, except for the topmost node or <em>root</em> node, which has no parent nodes.</p>
<p>A tree is very useful for representing data in a hierarchical or sorted format. For example, one common use of a tree data structure is to represent knowledge and decisions that can be made to find particular items. The popular children&rsquo;s game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions" rel="external" target="_blank">20 Questions</a> can be represented as a tree with 20 levels of nodes. Each node represents a particular question that can be asked, and the children of that node represent the possible answers. If the tree only contains yes and no questions, it can still represent up to $2^{20} = 1,408,576$ items!</p>
<h2 id="trie">Trie</h2>
<p>Another commonly used tree data structure is the <em>trie</em>, which is a special type of tree used to represent textual data. Ever wonder how a computer can store an entire dictionary and quickly spell-check every single word in the language? It actually uses a trie!</p>
<p>Below is a small example of a trie data structure:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-053f5a9a67b5a1f7d27b26dbc0513cc3" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Trie Data Structure" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.9.trie.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>This trie contains the words &ldquo;to&rdquo;, &ldquo;tea&rdquo;, &ldquo;ted&rdquo;, &ldquo;ten&rdquo;, &ldquo;i&rdquo;, &ldquo;in&rdquo;, &ldquo;inn&rdquo; and &ldquo;A&rdquo; in just a few nodes and edges. Imagine creating a trie that could store the entire English language! While it might be large, we can hopefully see how it would be much more efficient to search and store that data in a trie instead of a linear data structure.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-a-tree">When to Use a Tree</h2>
<p>A tree is a great choice for a data structure when there is an inherent hierarchy in our data, such that some nodes or elements are naturally &ldquo;parents&rdquo; of other elements. Likewise, if we know that each element may only have one parent but many children, a tree becomes an excellent choice. Trees contain several limitations that graphs do not, but they are also very powerful data structures.</p>

<p>The last non-linear data structure we&rsquo;ll talk about is the <em>heap</em>, which is a specialized version of a tree. In a <em>heap</em>, we try to accomplish a few goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Store either the largest or smallest element in the heap at the root node,</li>
<li>Ensure that each parent node is either larger or smaller than all of its children, and</li>
<li>Minimize the height, or number of levels, of the tree.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we follow those three guidelines, a heap becomes the most efficient data structure for managing a set of data where we always want to get the maximum or minimum value each time we remove an element. These are typically called <em>priority queues</em>, since we remove items based on their priority instead of the order they entered the queue.</p>
<p>Because of this, heaps are very important in creating efficient algorithms that deal with ordered data.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-a-heap">When to Use a Heap</h2>
<p>As discussed above, a heap is an excellent data structure for when we need to store elements and then always be able to quickly retrieve either the smallest or largest element in the data structure. Heaps are a very specific version of a tree that specialize in efficiency over everything else, so they are only really good for a few specific uses.</p>

<p>The other major topic covered in this course is the use of <em>algorithms</em> to manipulate the data stored in our data structures.</p>
<p>An <em>algorithm</em> is best defined as a finite list of specific instructions for performing a task. In the real world, we see algorithms all the time. A recipe for cooking your favorite dish, instructions for how to fix a broken car, or a method for solving a complex mathematical equation can all be considered examples of an algorithm. The flowchart above shows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm" rel="external" target="_blank">Euclid&rsquo;s Algorithm</a> for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.</p>
<p>In this course, however, we&rsquo;re going to look specifically at the algorithms and algorithmic techniques that are most commonly used with data structures in computer programming.</p>
<h2 id="algorithmic-techniques">Algorithmic Techniques</h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-GYlZYCG-8">YouTube Video</a>

<p>An <em>algorithmic technique</em>, sometimes referred to as a <em>methodology</em> or <em>paradigm</em>, is a particular way to design an algorithm. While there are a few commonly used algorithms across different data structures, many times each program may need a unique algorithm, or at least an adaptation of an existing algorithm. to perform its work.</p>
<p>To make these numerous algorithms easier to understand, we can loosely categorize them based on the techniques they use to solve the problem. On the next few pages, we&rsquo;ll introduce some of the more commonly used algorithmic techniques in this course. Throughout this course, we will learn how to apply many of these techniques when designing algorithms that work with various data structures to accomplish a goal.</p>

<h1 id="brute-force">Brute Force</h1>

<p>The first algorithmic technique we&rsquo;ll use is the <em>brute force</em> technique. This is the algorithmic technique that most of us are most familiar with, even if we don&rsquo;t realize it.</p>
<p>Simply put, a brute force algorithm will try all possible solutions to the problem, only stopping when it finds one that is the actual solution. A great example of a brute force algorithm in action is plugging in a USB cable. Many times, we will try one way, and if that doesn&rsquo;t work, flip it over and try the other. Likewise, if we have a large number of keys but are unsure which one fits in a particular lock, we can just try each key until one works. That&rsquo;s the essence of the brute force approach to algorithmic design.</p>

<p>A great example of a brute force algorithm is finding the closest pair of points in a multidimensional space. This could be as simple as finding the two closest cities on a map, or the two closest stars in a galaxy.</p>
<p>To find the answer, a brute force approach would be to simply calculate the distance between each individual pair of points, and then keep track of the minimum distance found. A pseudocode version of this algorithm would be similar to the following.</p>

<p>In the project for this module, we&rsquo;ll implement a few different brute-force algorithms to solve simple problems. This will help us gain more experience with this particular technique.</p>

<h1 id="divide-and-conquer">Divide and Conquer</h1>

<p>The next most common algorithmic technique is <em>divide and conquer</em>. A divide and conquer algorithm works just like it sounds. First, it will divide the problem into at least two or more smaller problems, and then it will try to solve each of those problems individually. It might even try to subdivide those smaller problems again and again to finally get to a small enough problem that it is easy to solve.</p>
<p>A great real-world example of using a divide and conquer approach to solving a problem is when we need to look for something that we&rsquo;ve lost around the house. Instead of trying to search the entire house, we can subdivide the problem into smaller parts by looking in each room separately. Then, within each room, we can even further subdivide the problem by looking at each piece of furniture individually. By reducing the problem&rsquo;s size and complexity, it becomes easier to search through each individual piece of furniture in the house, either finding our lost object or eliminating that area as the likely location it will be found.</p>
<h2 id="example---binary-search">Example - Binary Search</h2>
<p><a href="#R-image-14316cbfba92e205592c0077d643386a" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Sorted List" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.14.list1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>One great example of a divide and conquer algorithm is the <em>binary search</em> algorithm. If we have a list of data that has already been sorted, as seen in the figure above, we can easily find any item in the list using a divide and conquer process.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say we want to find the value $19$ in that list. First, we can look at the item in the middle of the list, which is $23$. Is it our desired number? Unfortunately, it is not. So, we need to figure out how we can use it to divide our input into a smaller problem. Thankfully, we know the list is sorted, so we can use that to our advantage. If our desired number is less than the middle number, we know that it must exist in the first half of the list. Likewise, if it is greater than the middle number, it must be in the second half. In this case, since $19$ is less than $23$, we must only look at the first half of the list.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-138ea5c44197386e736675f5091c295e" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Sorted List 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.14.list2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-138ea5c44197386e736675f5091c295e"><img alt="Sorted List 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.14.list2.png"></a></p>
<p>Now we can just repeat that process, this time using only the first half of the original list. This is the powerful feature of a divide and conquer algorithm. Once we&rsquo;ve figured out how to divide our data, we can usually follow the same steps again to solve the smaller problems as well.</p>
<p>Once again, we ask ourselves if $12$, the centermost number in the list, is the one we are looking for. Once again, it is not, but we know that $19$ is greater than $12$, so we&rsquo;ll need to look in the second half of the list.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-0edbaee61dc8ea701209389b1738890d" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Sorted List 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.14.list3.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Finally, we have reduced our problem to the simplest, or <em>base case</em> of the problem. Here, we simply need to determine if the single item in the list is the number we are looking for. In this case, it is! So, we can return that our original list did indeed include the number $19$.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll explore many ways of using divide and conquer algorithms in this course, especially when we learn to sort and search through lists of values.</p>

<h1 id="greedy">Greedy</h1>

<p>Another algorithmic technique that we&rsquo;ll learn about is the <em>greedy</em> technique. In a greedy algorithm, the program tries to build a solution one piece at a time. At each step, it will act &ldquo;greedy&rdquo; by choosing the piece that it thinks is the best choice for the solution based on the available information. Instead of trying every possible solution like a brute force algorithm or dividing the problem into smaller parts like the divide and conquer approach, a greedy algorithm will just try to construct the one best answer it can.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-26a03ebbdc91399c6cd7aa7c64a0b693" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Greedy Coins" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.15.coins.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-26a03ebbdc91399c6cd7aa7c64a0b693"><img alt="Greedy Coins" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.15.coins.png"></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>For example, we can use a greedy algorithm to determine the fewest number of coins needed to give change, as shown in the example above. If the customer is owed $36$ cents, and we have coins worth $20$ cents, $10$ cents, $5$ cents and $1$ cent, how many coins are needed to reach $36$ cents?</p>
<p>In a greedy solution, we could choose the coin with the highest value that is less than the change required, give that to the customer, and subtract its value from the remaining change. In this case, it will indeed produce the optimal solution.</p>
<p>In fact, both the United States dollar and the European euro have a system of coins that will always produce the minimum number of coins with a greedy algorithm. So that&rsquo;s very helpful!</p>
<p>However, does it always work? What if we have a system that has coins worth $30$ cents, $18$ cents $4$ cents, and $1$ cent. Would a greedy algorithm produce the result with the minimum number of coins when making change for $36$ cents?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try it and see. First, we see that we can use a $30$ cent coin, leaving us with $6$ cents left. Then, we can use a single $4$ cent coin, as well as two $1$ cent coins for a total of $4$ coins: $30 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 36$.</p>
<p>Is that the minimum number of coins?</p>
<p>It turns out that this system includes a coin worth $18$ cents. So, to make $36$ cents, we really only need $2$ coins: $18 + 18 = 36$!</p>
<p>This is the biggest weakness of the greedy approach to algorithm design. A greedy algorithm will find <em>a</em> possible solution, but it is not guaranteed to be the <em>best</em> possible solution. Sometimes it will work just fine, but other times it may produce solutions that are not very good at all. So we always must consider that when creating an algorithm using a <em>greedy</em> technique.</p>

<h1 id="recursion">Recursion</h1>

<p><a href="#R-image-d6627cc67deae1dbbae3fea1b56081e5" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Google Recursion" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.16.google.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-d6627cc67deae1dbbae3fea1b56081e5"><img alt="Google Recursion" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.16.google.png"></a></p>
<p>The next algorithmic technique we&rsquo;ll discuss is <em>recursion</em>. Recursion is closely related to the divide and conquer method we discussed earlier. However, <em>recursion</em> itself is a very complicated term to understand. It usually presents one of the most difficult challenges for a novice programmer to overcome when learning to write more advanced programs. Don&rsquo;t worry! We&rsquo;ll spend an entire module on recursion later in this course.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-recursion">What is Recursion?</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to define recursion. In one sense, recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller versions of the problem, very similar to the divide and conquer approach.</p>
<p>However, to most programmers, the term <em>recursion</em> is used to describe a function or method that calls itself inside of its own code. It may seem strange at first, but there are many instances in programming where a method can actually call itself again to help solve a difficult problem. However, writing recursive programs can be tricky at first, since there are many ways to make simple errors using recursion that cause our programs to break.</p>
<p>Mastering recursion takes quite a bit of time and practice, and nearly every programmer has a strong memory of the first time recursion made sense in their minds. So, it is important to make sure we understand it! In fact, it is so notable, that when we search for &ldquo;recursion&rdquo; on Google, it helpfully prompts us if we want to search for &ldquo;recursion&rdquo; instead, as seen at the top of this page.</p>
<h2 id="example---factorial">Example - Factorial</h2>
<p>A great example of a recursive method is calculating the <em>factorial</em> of a number. We may recall from mathematics that the factorial of a number is the product of each integer from 1 up to and including that number. For example, the factorial of $5$, written as $5!$, is calculated as $5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1  = 120$</p>
<p>We can easily write a traditional method to calculate the factorial of a number as follows.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function ITERATIVE<span class="nb">_</span>FACTORIAL(N)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    RESULT = 1
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    loop I from 1 to N:
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        RESULT = RESULT * I
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end loop
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    return RESULT
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, we may also realize that the value of $5!$ is the same as $4! * 5$. If we already know how to find the factorial of $4$, we can just multiply that result by $5$ to find the factorial of $5$. As it turns out, there are many problems in the real world that work just like this, and, in fact, many of the data structures we&rsquo;ll learn about are built in a similar way.</p>
<p>We can rewrite this iterative function to be a recursive function instead.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function RECURSIVE<span class="nb">_</span>FACTORIAL(N)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    if N == 1
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return 1
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    else
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return N * RECURSIVE<span class="nb">_</span>FACTORIAL(N - 1)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end if
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see, a recursive function includes two important elements, the <em>base case</em> and a <em>recursive case</em>. We need to include the base case so we can stop calling our recursive function over and over again, and actually reach a solution. This is similar to the termination condition of a <strong>for loop</strong> or <strong>while loop</strong>. If we forget to include the base case, our program will recurse infinitely!</p>
<p>The second part, the recursive case, is used to reduce the problem to a smaller version of the same problem. In this case, we reduce $N!$ to $N * (N - 1)!$. Then, we can just call our function again to solve the problem $(N - 1)!$, and multiply the result by $N$ to find the solution to $N!$.</p>
<p>So, if we have a problem that can be reduced to a smaller instance of itself, we may be able to use recursion to solve it!</p>

<h1 id="graph-traversal">Graph Traversal</h1>

<p><a href="#R-image-0341ca3ad24782995235aa554ffd2ef0" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Graph Traversals" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.17.graph.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Beyond the algorithmic techniques we&rsquo;ve introduced so far, there are a number of techniques that deal specifically with data stored in non-linear data structures based on graphs. Generally speaking, we can group all of these algorithms under the heading <em>graph traversal</em> algorithms.</p>
<p>A graph traversal algorithm constructs an answer to a problem by moving between nodes in a graph using the graph&rsquo;s edges, thereby <em>traversing</em> the graph. For example, a graph traversal algorithm could be used by a mapping program to construct a route from one city to another on a map, or to determine friends in common on a social networking website.</p>
<h2 id="example---dijkstras-algorithm">Example - Dijkstra&rsquo;s Algorithm</h2>
<p><a href="#R-image-c521ae3591b3c6a35b05b38e252aa442" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Dijkstra&rsquo;s Algorithm on a Graph" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.17.dijkstra1.gif" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-c521ae3591b3c6a35b05b38e252aa442"><img alt="Dijkstra&rsquo;s Algorithm on a Graph" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.17.dijkstra1.gif"></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A great example of a graph traversal algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm" rel="external" target="_blank">Dijkstra&rsquo;s Algorithm</a>, which can be used to find the shortest path between two selected nodes in a graph. In the image above, we can see the process of running Dijkstra&rsquo;s Algorithm on a graph that contains just a few nodes.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-beaa373b0efd38d8d5676f1ab974f36c" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Dijkstra&rsquo;s Algorithm in a Plane" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/4/4.17.dijkstra.gif" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Of course, we can use the same approach on any open space, as seen in this animation. Starting at the lower left corner, the algorithm slowly works toward the goal node, but it eventually runs into an obstacle. So, it must find a way around the obstacle while still finding the shortest path to the goal.</p>
<p>Algorithms such as Dijkstra&rsquo;s Algorithm, and a more refined version called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm" rel="external" target="_blank">A* Algorithm</a> are used in many different computer programs to help find a path between two points, especially in video games.</p>

<h1 id="programming-by-contract">Programming by Contract</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir93pt3KO7c">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In this course, we will learn how to develop several different data structures, and then use those data structures in programs that implement several different types of algorithms. However, one of the most difficult parts of programming is clearly explaining what a program should do and how it should perform.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-119f28f4996a651f390fce8063aa77c0" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="UML Diagram Example" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/3/3.1.videouml.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-119f28f4996a651f390fce8063aa77c0"><img alt="UML Diagram Example" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/3/3.1.videouml.png"></a></p>
<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve used UML class diagrams to discuss the structure of a program. It can give us information about the classes, attributes, and methods that our program will contain, as well as the overall relationships between the classes. We can even learn if attributes and methods are private or public, and more.</p>
<p>However, to describe what each method does, we have simply relied on descriptions in plain language up to this point, with no specific format at all. In this module, we&rsquo;ll introduce the concept of <em>programming by contract</em> to help us provide more specific information about what each method should do and the expectations we can count on based on the inputs and outputs of the method.</p>
<p>Specifically, we&rsquo;ll learn about the <em>preconditions</em> that are applied to the parameters of a method to make sure they are valid, the <em>postconditions</em> that the method will guarantee if the preconditions are met, and the <em>invariants</em> that a loop or data structure will maintain.</p>
<p>Finally, we can put all of that information together to discuss how to prove that an algorithm correctly performs the task it was meant to, and how to make sure that it works correctly in all possible cases.</p>

<h1 id="preconditions">Preconditions</h1>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s discuss preconditions. A precondition is an expectation applied to any parameters and existing variables when a method or function is called. Phrased a different way, the preconditions should all be true before the method is called. If all of the preconditions are met, the function can proceed and is expected to function properly. However, if any one of the preconditions are not met, the function may either reach an exception, prompt the user to correct the issue, or produce invalid output, depending on how it is written.</p>
<h2 id="example---area-of-a-triangle">Example - Area of a Triangle</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider an example method to see how we can define the preconditions applied to that method. In this example, we&rsquo;re going to write a method <code>triangleArea(side1, side2, side3)</code> that will calculate the area of a triangle, given the lengths of the sides of the triangle.</p>
<p>So, to determine what the preconditions of that method should be, we must think about what we know about a triangle and what sort of data we expect to receive.</p>
<p>For example, we know that the length of each side should be a number. In addition, those lengths should all be positive, so each one must be strictly greater than $0$.</p>
<p>We can also determine if we expect the length to be whole numbers or floating-point numbers. To make this example simpler, let&rsquo;s just work with whole numbers.</p>
<p>When looking at preconditions, determining the types and expected range of values of each parameter is a major first step. However, sometimes we must also look at the relationship between the parameters to find additional preconditions that we must consider.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-fe439d1b160d9b494532f3cf490126de" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Triangle Inequality" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/3/3.2.triangleinequal_wiki.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-fe439d1b160d9b494532f3cf490126de"><img alt="Triangle Inequality" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/3/3.2.triangleinequal_wiki.svg"></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality" rel="external" target="_blank">triangle inequality</a> states that the longest side of a triangle must be strictly shorter than the sum of the other two sides. Otherwise, those sides will not create a triangle. So, another precondition must state that the sides satisfy the triangle inequality.</p>
<p>All together, we&rsquo;ve found the following preconditions for our method <code>triangleArea(side1, side2, side3)</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>side1</code>, <code>side2</code> and <code>side3</code> each must each be an integer that is strictly greater than $0$</li>
<li><code>side1</code>, <code>side2</code> and <code>side3</code> must satisfy the triangle inequality</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="precondition-failures">Precondition Failures</h2>
<p>What if our method is called and provided a set of parameters that do not meet the preconditions described above? As a programmer, there are several actions we can take in our code to deal with the situation.</p>
<h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>
<p>One of the most common ways to handle precondition failures is to simply throw or raise exceptions from our method as soon as it determines that the preconditions are not met. In this way, we can quickly indicate that the program is unable to perform the requested operation, and leave it up to the code that called that method to either handle the exception or ignore it and allow the program to crash.</p>
<p>This method is best used within the model portions of a program written using the Model-View-Controller or MVC architecture. By doing so, this allows our controller to react to problems quickly, usually by requesting additional input from the user using the view portion of the program.</p>
<h3 id="prompt-user">Prompt User</h3>
<p>In simpler programs, it is common for the code to simply handle the precondition failure by asking the user for new input. This is commonly done in programs that are small enough to fit in a single class, instead of being developed using MVC architecture.</p>
<h3 id="incorrect-output">Incorrect Output</h3>
<p>Of course, we could choose to simply ignore these precondition failures and allow our code to continue running. IN that case, if the preconditions are not met, then the answer we receive may be completely invalid. On the next page, we&rsquo;ll discuss how failed preconditions affect whether we can trust our method&rsquo;s output.</p>

<h1 id="postconditions">Postconditions</h1>

<p>Next, we can discuss postconditions. A postcondition is a statement that is guaranteed to be true after a method is executed, provided all of the preconditions were met. If any one of the preconditions were not met, then we can&rsquo;t count on the postcondition being true either. This is the most important concept surrounding preconditions and postconditions.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>If the preconditions of a method are all true when a method is called, then we may assume the postconditions are true after the method is complete, provided it is written <strong>correctly</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="example---area-of-a-triangle">Example - Area of a Triangle</h2>
<p>On the last page, we discussed the preconditions for a method <code>triangleArea(side1, side2, side3)</code> that will calculate the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides. Those preconditions are:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>side1</code>, <code>side2</code> and <code>side3</code> each must each be an integer that is strictly greater than $0$</li>
<li><code>side1</code>, <code>side2</code> and <code>side3</code> must satisfy the triangle inequality</li>
</ol>
<p>So, once the method completes, what should our postcondition be? In this case, we want to find a statement that would be always true if all of the preconditions are met.</p>
<p>Since the method will be calculating the area of the triangle, the strongest postcondition we can use is the most obvious one:</p>
<ol>
<li>The method will return the area of a triangle with side lengths <code>side1</code>, <code>side2</code> and <code>side3</code></li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s really it!</p>
<p>Of course, there are a few other postconditions that we could consider, especially when we start working with data structures and objects. For example, one of the most powerful postconditions is the statement:</p>
<ol>
<li>The values of the parameters are not modified from their original values</li>
</ol>
<p>When we call a method that accepts an array or object as a parameter, we know that we can modify the values stored in that array or object because the parameter is handled in a <em>call-by-reference</em> fashion in most languages. So, if we don&rsquo;t state that this postcondition applies, we can&rsquo;t guarantee that the method did not change the values in the array or object we provided as a parameter.</p>
<h2 id="precondition-failures-incorrect-output">Precondition Failures: Incorrect Output</h2>
<p>So, what if the preconditions are not met? Then what happens?</p>
<p>As we discussed on the previous page, if the preconditions are not met, then we cannot guarantee that the postcondition will be true once the method executes. In fact, it may be decidedly incorrect, depending on how we implement the method.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-e09cb0136e6b5292d56cf7a3c4d1a4fb" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Heron&rsquo;s Formula" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/3/3.3.triangle_wiki.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>For example, the simplest way to find the area of a triangle given the lengths of all three sides is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula" rel="external" target="_blank">Heron&rsquo;s formula</a>, which can be written mathematically as:</p>
$$
A = 1/4 \sqrt{(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)}
$$
<p>Since this is a mathematical formula, it is always possible to get a result from it, even if all of the preconditions are not met. For example, the inputs could be floating-point values instead of integers, or they may not satisfy the triangle inequality. In that case, the function may still produce a result, but it will not represent the actual area of the triangle described, mainly because the parameters provided describe a triangle that cannot exist in the real world. So, we must always be careful not to assume that a method will always provide the correct output unless we provide parameters that make all of its preconditions true.</p>

<h1 id="unit-testing">Unit Testing</h1>

<p>Once we&rsquo;ve written a program, how can we verify that it works correctly? There are many ways to do this, but one of the most common is <em>unit testing</em>.</p>
<h2 id="unit-testing">Unit Testing</h2>
<p>Unit testing a program involves writing code that actually runs the program and verifies that it works correctly. In addition, many unit tests will also check that the program produces appropriate errors when given bad input, or even that it won&rsquo;t crash when given invalid input.</p>
<p>For example, a simple unit test for the <code>maximum()</code> method would be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function MAXIMUMTEST()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    ARRAY = new array[5]
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    ARRAY[0] = 5
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    ARRAY[1] = 25
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    ARRAY[2] = 10
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    ARRAY[3] = 15
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    ARRAY[4] = 0
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    RESULT = MAXIMUM(ARRAY)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    if RESULT == 25:
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        print &#34;Test Passed&#34;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end if
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code will simply create an array that we know the maximum value of, and then confirm that our own <code>maximum()</code> method will find the correct result.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a very simplistic unit test, and it would take several more unit tests to fully confirm that the <code>maximum()</code> method works completely correctly.</p>
<p>However, it is important to understand how this test relates to the preconditions and postconditions that were established on previous pages. Here, the unit tests creates a variable <code>ARRAY</code> which is an array of at least one numerical value. Therefore, it has met the preconditions for the <code>maximum()</code> method, so we can assume that if <code>maximum()</code> is written correctly, then the postconditions will be true once it is has executed. This is the key assumption behind unit tests.</p>

  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Why Does This Matter?</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>In this course, you will be asked to build several data structures and implement algorithms that use those data structures. In the assignment descriptions, we may describe these methods using the preconditions and postconditions applied to them. Similarly, we&rsquo;ll learn about <em>structural invariants</em> of data structures, which help us ensure that your data structures are always valid.</p>
<p>Then, to grade your work, we use an autograder that contains several unit tests. Those unit tests are used to confirm that you code works correctly, and they do so by providing input that either satisfies the preconditions, meaning that the test expects that the postconditions will be true, or by providing invalid input and testing how your code reacts to those situations.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see these concepts throughout this course, so it is important to be familiar with them now.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we introduced a number of different <em>data structures</em> that we can use in our programs. In addition, we explored several <em>algorithmic techniques</em> we can use to develop algorithms that manipulate these data structures to allow us to solve complex problems in our code.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of this course, as well as a subsequent course, we&rsquo;ll explore many of these data structures and techniques in detail. We hope that introducing them all at the same time here will allow us to compare and contrast each one as we learn more about it, while still keeping in mind that there are many different structures and techniques that will be available to us in the future.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-stack">What is a Stack?</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgA-q4kOgjk">YouTube Video</a>

<p>A stack is a data structure with two main operations that are simple in concept. One is the <code>push</code> operation that lets you put data into the data structure and the other is the <code>pop</code> operation that lets you get data out of the structure.</p>
<p>Why do we call it a stack? Think about a stack of boxes. When you stack boxes, you can do one of two things: put boxes onto the stack and take boxes off of the stack. And here is the key. You can only put boxes on the top of the stack, and you can only take boxes off the top of the stack. That&rsquo;s how stacks work in programming as well!</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-af7ba4a9468a2fdc74534a58cbcc75ad" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Boxes in a Stack" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.1.boxes.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>A stack is what we call a &ldquo;Last In First Out&rdquo;, or <strong>LIFO</strong>, data structure. That means that when we <code>pop</code> a piece of data off the stack, we get the last piece of data we put on the stack.</p>

<p>So, where do we see stacks in the real world? A great example is repairing an automobile. It is much easier to put a car back together if we put the pieces back on in the reverse order we took them off. Thus, as we take parts off a car, it is highly recommended that we lay them out in a line. Then, when we are ready to put things back together, we can just start at the last piece we took off and work our way back. This operation is exactly how a stack works.</p>
<p>Another example is a stack of chairs. Often in schools or in places that hold different types of events, chairs are stacked in large piles to make moving the chairs easier and to make their storage more efficient. Once again, however, if we are going to put chairs onto the stack or remove chairs from the stack, we are going to have to do it from the top.</p>

<h1 id="stacks-in-code">Stacks in Code</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBAZYibDwfk">YouTube Video</a>

<p>How do we implement stacks in code? One way would be to use something we already understand, an array. Remember that arrays allow us to store multiple items, where each entry in the array has a unique index number. This is a great way to implement stacks. We can store items directly in the array and use a special <code>top</code> variable to hold the index of the top of the stack.</p>
<p>The following figure shows how we might implement a stack with an array. First, we define our array <code>myStack</code> to be an array that can hold 10 numbers, with an index of 0 to 9. Then we create a <code>top</code> variable that keeps track of the index at the top of the array.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-8a5aedcaccae27787ff0b62beebf366e" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Empty Stack" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.3.empty.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-8a5aedcaccae27787ff0b62beebf366e"><img alt="Empty Stack" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.3.empty.png"></a></p>
<p>Notice that since we have not put any items onto the stack, we initialize <code>top</code> to be <code>-1</code>. Although this is not a legal index into the array, we can use it to recognize when the stack is empty, and it makes manipulating items in the array much simpler. When we want to <code>push</code> an item onto the stack, we follow a simple procedure as shown below. Of course, since our array has a fixed size, we need to make sure that we don&rsquo;t try to put an item in a full array. Thus, the precondition is that the array cannot be full. Enforcing this precondition is the function of the <code>if</code> statement at the beginning of the function. If the array is already full, then we&rsquo;ll throw an exception and let the user handle the situation. Next, we increment the <code>top</code> variable to point to the next available location to store our data. Then it is just a matter of storing the item into the array at the index stored in <code>top</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function PUSH(ITEM)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    if MYSTACK is full then
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        throw exception
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end if
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    TOP = TOP + 1
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    MYSTACK[TOP] = ITEM
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If we call the function <code>push(a)</code> and follow the pseudocode above, we will get an array with <code>a</code> stored in <code>myStack[0]</code> and <code>top</code> will have the value <code>0</code> as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-63dbd485ff7eb021714f2032078de9e6" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="One Item" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.3.one.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-63dbd485ff7eb021714f2032078de9e6"><img alt="One Item" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.3.one.png"></a></p>
<p>As we push items onto the stack, we continue to increment <code>top</code> and store the items on the stack. The figure below shows how the stack would look if we performed the following <code>push</code> operations.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">push(&#34;b&#34;)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">push(&#34;c&#34;)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">push(&#34;d&#34;)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">push(&#34;e&#34;)</span></span></code></pre></div><p><a href="#R-image-0a8cf7e8269e723df8b2ae3ae812cf97" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Partial Stack" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.3.partial.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-0a8cf7e8269e723df8b2ae3ae812cf97"><img alt="Partial Stack" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.3.partial.png"></a></p>
<p>Although we are implementing our stack with an array, we often show stacks vertically instead of horizontally as shown below. In this way the semantics of <code>top</code> makes more sense.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-3c52462516ef27df0522633e74c3478e" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Vertical Stack" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.3.vertical.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Of course, the next question you might ask is &ldquo;how do we get items off the stack?”. As discussed above, we have a special operation called <code>pop</code> to take care of that for us. The pseudocode for the <code>pop</code> operation is shown below and is similar in structure to the <code>push</code> operation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function POP
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    if TOP == -1 then
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        throw exception
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end if
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    TOP = TOP - 1
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    return MYSTACK[TOP + 1]
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, instead of checking to see if the stack is full, we need to check if the stack is empty. Thus, our precondition is that the stack is not empty, which we evaluate by checking if <code>top</code> is equal to <code>-1</code>. If it is, we simply throw an exception and let the user handle it. If <code>myStack</code> is not empty, then we can go ahead and perform the <code>pop</code> function. We simply decrement the value of <code>top</code> and return the value stored in <code>myStack[top+1]</code>.</p>
<p>Now, if we perform three straight <code>pop</code> operations, we get the following stack.</p>

<h1 id="using-a-stack">Using a Stack</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-W8VdeqjbE">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Stacks are useful in many applications. Classic real-world software that uses stacks includes the undo feature in a text editor, or the forward and back features of web browsers. In a text editor, each user action is pushed onto the stack as it is performed. Then, if the user wants to undo an action, the text editor simply pops the stack to get the last action performed, and then undoes the action. The redo command can be implemented as a second stack. In this case, when actions are popped from the stack in order to undo them, they are pushed onto the redo stack.</p>
<h2 id="maze-explorer">Maze Explorer</h2>
<p>Another example is a maze exploration application. In this application, we are given a maze, a starting location, and an ending location. Our first goal is to find a path from the start location to the end location. Once we&rsquo;ve arrived at the end location, our goal becomes returning to the start location in the most direct manner.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-7eed351014104e86b082fdf5675cce67" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Empty Maze" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.7.mazeempty.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-7eed351014104e86b082fdf5675cce67"><img alt="Empty Maze" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.7.mazeempty.png"></a></p>
<p>We can do this simply with a stack. We will have to search the maze to find the path from the starting location to the ending location. Each time we take a step forward, we push that move onto a stack. If we run into a dead end, we can simply retrace our steps by popping moves off the list and looking for an alternative path. Once we reach the end state, we will have our path stored in the stack. At this point it becomes easy to follow our path backward by popping each move off the top of the stack and performing it. There is no searching involved.</p>
<p>We start with a maze, a <code>startCell</code>, a <code>goalCell</code>, and a <code>stack</code> as shown below. In this case our startCell is <code>0,0</code> and our end goal is <code>1,1</code>. We will store each location on the stack as we move to that location. We will also keep track of the direction we are headed: up, right, down, or left, which we&rsquo;ll abbreviate as <code>u</code>,<code>r</code>,<code>d</code>,and <code>l</code>.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-7730efde02cdbf3ed2c02ca4f54bb7b0" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Maze Step 0" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.7.maze0.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-7730efde02cdbf3ed2c02ca4f54bb7b0"><img alt="Maze Step 0" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.7.maze0.png"></a></p>
<p>In our first step, we will store our location and direction <code>0,0,u</code> on the stack.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-fc93647d612fd2b8416bc619fcfd2641" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Maze Step 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.7.maze1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>For the second step, we will try to move &ldquo;up&rdquo;, or to location <code>1,0</code>. However, that square in the maze is blocked. So, we change our direction to <code>r</code> as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-35b8d5f7154cbde10b838c4a94a53d57" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Maze Step 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.7.maze2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-35b8d5f7154cbde10b838c4a94a53d57"><img alt="Maze Step 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.7.maze2.png"></a></p>
<p>After turning right, we attempt to move in that direction to square <code>0,1</code>, which is successful. Thus, we create a new location <code>0,1,u</code> and push it on the stack. (Here we always assume we point up when we enter a new square.) The new state of the maze and our stack are shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-31a3fb99327754fa8325f9a43510c1de" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Maze Step 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.7.maze3.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Next, we try to move to <code>1,1</code>, which again is successful. We again push our new location <code>1,1,u</code> onto the stack. And, since our current location matches our <code>goalCell</code> location (ignoring the direction indicator) we recognize that we have reached our goal.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-7d7580f5e1abe73707c435da650b8c8b" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Maze Step 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.7.maze4.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s one thing to find our goal cell, but it&rsquo;s another thing to get back to our starting position. However, we already know the path back given our wise choice of data structures. Since we stored the path in a stack, we can now simply reverse our path and move back to the start cell. All we need to do is pop the top location off of the stack and move to that location over and over again until the stack is empty. The pseudocode for following the path back home is simple.</p>

<h1 id="path-finding-algorithm">Path Finding Algorithm</h1>

<p><a href="#R-image-ba183f13d20093afaa72c1accb822da1" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Maze Step 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/5/5.7.maze4.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>The pseudocode for finding the initial path using the stack is shown below. We assume the enclosing class has already defined a stack called <code>myStack</code> and the datatype called <code>Cell</code>, which represents the squares in the maze. The algorithm also uses three helper functions as described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getNextCell(maze, topCell)</code>: computes the next cell based on our current cell&rsquo;s location and direction;</li>
<li><code>incrementDirection(topCell)</code>: increments a cell&rsquo;s direction attribute following the clockwise sequence of up, right, down, left, and then finally done, which means that we&rsquo;ve tried all directions; and</li>
<li><code>valid(nextCell)</code>: determines if a cell is valid. A cell is invalid if it is &ldquo;blocked&rdquo;, is outside the boundaries of the maze, or is in the current path (i.e., if it exists in the stack).</li>
</ul>
<p>The parameters of <code>findPath</code> are a 2-dimensional array called <code>maze</code>, the <code>startCell</code> and the <code>endCell</code>. The algorithm begins by pushing the <code>startCell</code> onto <code>myStack</code>. The cell at the top of the stack will always represent our current cell, while the remaining cells in the stack represent the path of cells taken to reach the current cell.</p>
<p>Next, we enter a loop, where we will do the bulk of the work. We peek at the cell on the top of the stack in order to use it in our computations. If the <code>topCell</code> is equal to our <code>goalCell</code>, then we are done and return <code>true</code> indicating that we have found a path to the goal.</p>
<p>If we are not at our goal, we check to see if we have searched all directions from the current cell. If that is the case, then the <code>direction</code> attribute of the <code>topCell</code> will have been set to <code>done</code>. If the <code>direction</code> attribute of <code>topCell</code> is equal to <code>done</code>, then we pop the <code>topCell</code> of the stack, effectively leaving that cell and returning to the next cell in the stack. This is an algorithmic technique called backtracking.</p>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, if we have not searched in all directions from <code>topCell</code>, we will try to explore a new cell (<code>nextCell</code>) adjacent to the <code>topCell</code>. Specifically, <code>nextCell</code> will be the adjacent cell in the direction stored by the <code>direction</code> attribute. We then increment the direction attribute of the <code>topCell</code> so if we end up backtracking, we will know which direction to try next.</p>
<p>Before we push the <code>nextCell</code> onto the stack, we must first check to see if it&rsquo;s a valid cell by calling the helper function <code>valid</code>. A cell is valid if it is open to be explored. A cell is invalid if it is &ldquo;blocked,&rdquo; is outside the boundaries of the maze, or is in the current path (i.e., if it exists in the stack). To help us determine if a cell is in the stack, we will need to extend our stack operations to include a <code>find</code> operation that searches the stack while leaving its contents intact. You will get to implement this operation in your project.</p>
<p>If <code>nextCell</code> is valid, we then check to make sure that the stack is not already full. If it is, we simply call <code>doubleCapacity</code> and continue on our way. Then we push <code>nextCell</code> onto <code>myStack</code> so it will become our next <code>topCell</code> on the next pass through the loop.</p>
<p>After we have explored all possible paths through the maze, the loop will eventually end, and the operation will return <code>false</code> indicating no path was found. While this is not the most efficient path finding algorithm, it is a good example of using stacks for backtracking. Also, if we do find a path and return, the path will be saved in the stack. We can then use the previous pseudocode for retracing our steps and going back to the <code>startCell</code>.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-queue">What is a Queue?</h1>

<p>A queue (pronounced like the letter &ldquo;q&rdquo;) data structure organizes data in a First In, First Out (FIFO) order: the first piece of data put into the queue is the first piece of data available to remove from the queue. A queue functions just like the line you would get into to go into a ballgame, movie, or concert:  the person that arrives first is the first to get into the venue.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-3ca075c035c40d118cb02b039248e22e" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Students in a Queue" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/8/8.1.queue.jpeg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>You might be thinking that this sounds a lot like the stack structure we studied a few modules back, with the exception that the stack was a Last in, First Out (LIFO) structure. If so, you are correct. The real difference between a stack and a queue is how we take data out of the data structure. In a stack, we put data onto the top of the stack and removed it from the top as well. With a queue, we put data onto the end (or rear) of the queue and remove it from the start (or front) of the queue.</p>

<p>The name for queues comes the word in British English used to describe a line of people. Instead of forming lines to wait for some service, British form queues. Thus, when we think of queues, often the first picture to come to mind is a group of people standing in a line. Of course, this is exactly how a computer queue operates as well. The first person in line gets served first. If I get into line before you do, then I will be served before you do.</p>

<p>Of course, there are other examples of queues besides lines of people. You can think of a train as a long line of railway cars. They are all connected and move together as the train engine pulls them. A line of cars waiting to go through a toll booth or to cross a border is another good example of a queue. The first car in line will be the first car to get through the toll booth. In the picture below, there are actually several lines.</p>

<h1 id="queues-in-code">Queues in Code</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0wMfzsq42c">YouTube Video</a>

<p>How do we implement queues in code? Like we did with stacks, we will use an array, which is an easily understandable way to implement queues. We will store data directly in the array and use special <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> variables to keep track of the start of the queue and the end of the queue.</p>
<p>The following figure shows how we might implement a queue with an array. First, we define our array <code>myQueue</code> to be an array that can hold 10 numbers, with an index of 0 to 9. Then we create a <code>start</code> variable to keep track of the index at the start of the queue and an <code>end</code> variable to keep track of the end of the array.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-428db44482f88260b060c7fd50482de4" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Empty Queue" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/8/8.3.empty.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-428db44482f88260b060c7fd50482de4"><img alt="Empty Queue" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/8/8.3.empty.png"></a></p>
<p>Notice that since we have not put any items into the queue, we initialize <code>start</code> to be <code>-1</code>. Although this is not a legal index into the array, we can use it like we did with stacks to recognize when we have not yet put anything into the queue. As we will see, this also makes manipulating items in the array much simpler. However, to make our use of the array more efficient, <code>-1</code> will not always indicate that the queue is empty. We will allow the queue to wrap around the array from the <code>start</code> index to the <code>end</code> index. We&rsquo;ll see an example of this behavior later.</p>
<p>When we want to <em>enqueue</em> an item into the queue, we follow the simple procedure as shown below. Of course, since our array has a fixed size, we need to make sure that we don&rsquo;t try to put an item in a full array. Thus, the precondition is that the array cannot be full. Enforcing this precondition is the function of the <code>if</code> statement at line 2. If the array is already full, then we&rsquo;ll throw an exception in line 3 and let the caller handle the situation. Next, we store <code>item</code> at the <code>end</code> location and then compute the new value of <code>end</code> in line 5. Line 6 uses the modulo operator <code>%</code> to return the remainder of the division of $(\text{end} + 1) / \text{length of myQueue}$. In our example, this is helpful when we get to the end of our ten-element array. If <code>end == 9</code> before <code>enqueue</code> was called, the function would store <code>item</code> in <code>myQueue[9]</code> and then line 4 would cause <code>end</code> to be $(9 +1) % 10$ or $10 % 10$ which is simply $0$, essentially wrapping the queue around the end of the array and continuing it at the beginning of the array.</p>

<p>Given our initial configuration above, if we performed an <code>enqueue(7)</code> function call, the result would look like the following.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-b3b3cd693b2954065ba64adbf48163e0" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Queue with 1 Element" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/8/8.3.enqueue1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-b3b3cd693b2954065ba64adbf48163e0"><img alt="Queue with 1 Element" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/8/8.3.enqueue1.png"></a></p>
<p>Notice that the value 7 was stored at <code>myQueue[0]</code> in line 5, <code>end</code> was updated to <code>1</code> in line 6, and <code>start</code> was set to <code>0</code> in line 8. Now, let&rsquo;s assume we continue to perform <code>enqueue</code> operations until <code>myQueue</code> is almost filled as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-75e3f684c16a583ba932feb2d164cb11" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Queue with 9 Elements" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/8/8.3.enqueue9.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-75e3f684c16a583ba932feb2d164cb11"><img alt="Queue with 9 Elements" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/8/8.3.enqueue9.png"></a></p>
<p>If at this point, we enqueue another number, say <code>-35</code>, the modulo operator in line 6 would help us wrap the end of the list around the array and back to the beginning as expected.  The result of this function call is shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-8e3f55183d35704810b98a74586b7176" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Queue with 10 Elements" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/8/8.3.enqueue10.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-8e3f55183d35704810b98a74586b7176"><img alt="Queue with 10 Elements" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/8/8.3.enqueue10.png"></a></p>
<p>Now we have a problem! The array is full of numbers and if we try to enqueue another number, the <code>enqueue</code> function will raise an exception in line 3. However, this example also gives us insight into what the <code>isFull</code> condition should be. Notice that both <code>start</code>, and <code>end</code> are pointing at the same array index. You may want to think about this a little, but you should be able to convince yourself that whenever <code>start == end</code> we will be in a situation like the one above where the array is full, and we cannot safely enqueue another number.</p>
<p>To rectify our situation, we need to have a function to take things out of the queue. We call this function <code>dequeue</code>, which returns the item at the beginning of the queue (pointed at by <code>start</code>) and updates the value of <code>start</code> to point to the next location in the queue. The pseudocode for the <code>dequeue</code> is shown below.</p>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">12</span><span class="cl"><span class="n">end</span> <span class="n">function</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Line 2 checks if the queue is empty and raises an exception in line 3 if it is. Otherwise, we copy the item at the <code>start</code> location into <code>item</code> at line 5 and then increment the value of <code>start</code> by <code>1</code>, using the modulo operator to wrap to the beginning of the array if needed in line 6. However, if we <code>dequeue</code> the last item in the queue, we will actually run into the same situation that we ran into in the <code>enqueue</code> when we filled the array, <code>start == end</code>. Since we need to differentiate between being full or empty (it&rsquo;s kind of important!), we reset the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> values back to their initial state when we dequeue the last item in the queue. That is, we set <code>start = -1</code> and <code>end = 0</code>. This way, we will always be able to tell the difference between the queue being empty or full. Finally, we return the item to the calling function in line 11.</p>

<h1 id="using-a-queue">Using a Queue</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05zPOJ8B5cA">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Queues are useful in many applications. Classic real-world software which uses queues includes the scheduling of tasks, sharing of resources, and processing of messages in the proper order. A common need is to schedule tasks to be executed based on their priority. This type of scheduling can be done in a computer or on an assembly line floor, but the basic concept is the same.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that we are putting windshields onto new cars in a production line. In addition, there are some cars that we want to rush through production faster than others. There are actually three different priorities:</p>
<ol>
<li>High priority: these cars have been ordered by customers who are waiting for them.</li>
<li>Medium priority: these cars have been ordered as &ldquo;fleet cars&rdquo; for specific companies.</li>
<li>Low priority: these cars are cars used to fill dealer inventories.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally, as cars come to the windshield station, we would be able to put their windshields in and send them to the next station before we received the next car. However, this is rarely the case. Since putting on windshields often requires special attention, cars tend to line up to get their windows installed. This is when their priority comes into account. Instead of using a simple queue to line cars up first-come, first-served in FIFO order, we would like to jump high priority cars to the head of the line.</p>
<p>While we could build a sophisticated queueing mechanism that would automatically insert cars in the appropriate order based on priority and then arrival time, we could also use a queue to handle each set of car priorities. A figure illustrating this situation is shown below. As cars come in, they are put in one of three queues: high priority, medium priority, or low priority. When the windshield station completes a car it then takes the next car from the highest priority queue.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-c21c7cbd2be73ab907312d259672a36c" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Car Windshield Installation Model" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/8/8.7.model.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-c21c7cbd2be73ab907312d259672a36c"><img alt="Car Windshield Installation Model" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/8/8.7.model.png"></a></p>
<p>The interesting part of the problem is the controller at the windshield station that determines which car will be selected to be worked on next. The controller will need to have the following interface:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function receiveCar(car, priority)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"> // receives a car from the previous station and places into a specific queue
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">function bool isEmpty()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"> // returns true if there are no more cars in the queue
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">function getCar() returns car
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"> // retrieves the next car based on priority</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Using this simple interface, we will define a class to act as the windshield station controller. It will receive cars from the previous station and get cars for the windshield station.</p>
<p>We start by defining the internal attributes and constructor for the <code>Controller</code> class as follows, using the Queue functions defined earlier in this module. We first declare three separate queues, one each for <code>high</code>, <code>medium</code>, and <code>low</code> priority cars. Next, we create the constructor for the <code>Controller</code> class. The constructor simply initializes our three queues with varying capacities based on the expected usage of each of the queues. Notice, that the <code>high</code> priority queue has the smallest capacity while the <code>low</code> priority queue has the largest capacity.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">class Controller
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    declare HIGH as a Queue
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    declare MEDIUM as a Queue
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    declare LOW as a Queue
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    function Controller()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        HIGH = new Queue(4)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        MEDIUM = new Queue(6)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        LOW = new Queue(8)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next, we need to define the interface function as defined above. We start with the <code>receiveCar</code> function. There are three cases based on the <code>priority</code> of the <code>car</code>. If we look at the first case for <code>priority == high</code>, we check to see if the <code>high</code> queue is full before calling the <code>enqueue</code> function to place the <code>car</code> into the <code>high</code> queue. If the queue is full, we raise an exception. We follow the exact same logic for the <code>medium</code> and <code>low</code> priority cars as well. Finally, there is a final <code>else</code> that captures the case where the user did not specific either <code>high</code>, <code>medium</code>, or <code>low</code> priority. In this case, an exception is raised.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function receiveCar(CAR, PRIORITY)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    if PRIORITY == high
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        if HIGH.isFull()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">            raise exception
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        else
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">            HIGH.enqueue(CAR)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        end if
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    else PRIORITY == medium
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        if MEDIUM.isFull()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">            raise exception
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        else
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">            MEDIUM.enqueue(CAR)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        end if
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    else PRIORITY == low
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        if LOW.isFull()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">            raise exception
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        else
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">            LOW.enqueue(CAR)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        end if
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    else
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        raise exception
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end if
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now we will define the <code>isEmpty</code> function. While we do not include an <code>isFull</code> function due to the ambiguity of what that would mean and how it might be useful, the <code>isEmpty</code> function will be useful for the windshield station to check before they request another call via the <code>getCar</code> function.</p>
<p>As you can see below, the <code>isEmpty</code> function simply returns the logical AND of each of the individual queue&rsquo;s <code>isEmpty</code> status. Thus, the function will return true if, and only if, each of the <code>high</code>, <code>medium</code>, and <code>low</code> queues are empty.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function isEmpty()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    return HIGH.isEmpty() and MEDIUM.isEmpty() and LOW.isEmpty()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, we are able to define the <code>getCar</code> function. It is similar in structure to the <code>receiveCar</code> function in that it checks each queue individually. In the case of <code>getCar</code>, the key to the priority mechanism we are developing is in the order we check the queues. In this case, we check them in the expected order from high to low. If the <code>high</code> queue is not empty, we get the car from that queue and return it to the calling function. If the <code>high</code> queue is empty, then we check the <code>medium</code> queue. Likewise, if the <code>medium</code> queue is empty, we check the low <code>queue</code>. Finally, if all of the queues are empty, we raise an exception.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function getCar()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    if not HIGH.isEmpty()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return HIGH.dequeue()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    else not MEDIUM.isEmpty()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return MEDIUM.dequeue()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    else not LOW.isEmpty()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return LOW.dequeue()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    else
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        raise exception
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end if
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div>

<h1 id="what-is-a-list">What is a List?</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1uVJeej-WM">YouTube Video</a>

<p>A list is a data structure that holds a sequence of data, such as the shopping list shown below. Each list has a head item and a tail item, with all other items placed linearly between the head and the tail. As we pick up items in the store, we will remove them, or cross them off the list. Likewise, if we get a text from our housemate to get some cookies, we can add them to the list as well.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-ff33c29ba60047959ba39d9274e7748c" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Shopping List" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.1.shopping.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-ff33c29ba60047959ba39d9274e7748c"><img alt="Shopping List" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.1.shopping.png"></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Lists are actually very general structures that we can use for a variety of purposes. One common example is the history section of a web browser. The web browser actually creates a list of past web pages we have visited, and each time we visit a new web page it is added to the list. That way, when we check our history, we can see all the web pages we have visited recently in the order we visited them. The list also allows us to scroll through the list and select one to revisit or select another one to remove from the history altogether.</p>
<p>Of course, we have already seen several instances of lists so far in programming, including arrays, stacks, and queues. However, lists are much more flexible than the arrays, stacks, and queues we have studied so far. Lists allow us to add or remove items from the head, tail, or anywhere in between. We will see how we can actually implement stacks and queues using lists later in this module.</p>

<h1 id="lists-in-the-real-world">Lists in the Real World</h1>

<p>Most of us see and use lists every day. We have a list for shopping as we saw above, but we may also have a &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list, a list of homework assignments, or a list of movies we want to watch. Some of us are list-makers and some are not, but we all know a list when we see it.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-35752e506ddcd58ce67123705395c6bf" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Playlist" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.2.playlist.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>However, there are other lists in the real world that we might not even think of as a list. For instance, a playlist on our favorite music app is an example of a list. A music app lets us move forward or backward in a list or choose a song randomly from a list. We can even reorder our list whenever we want.</p>
<p>All the examples we&rsquo;ve seen for stacks and queues can be thought of as lists as well. Stacks of chairs or moving boxes, railroad trains, and cars going through a tollbooth are all examples of special types of lists.</p>

<h1 id="lists-in-code">Lists in Code</h1>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-arrays">The Problem With Arrays</h2>
<p>To this point, we have been using arrays as our underlying data structures for implementing linear data structures such as stacks and queues. Given that with stacks and queues we only put items into the array and remove from either the start or end of the data structure, we have been able to make arrays work. However, there are some drawbacks to using arrays for stacks and queues as well as for more general data structures.</p>
<ol>
<li>We can run out of room in our array for our stacks or queues.</li>
<li>There is no good way to use memory efficiently. We have to use expensive &ldquo;double&rdquo; and &ldquo;halve&rdquo; capacity operations for stacks and queues when we need to use more or less memory.</li>
<li>Inserting an item into the middle of a sorted list will be very costly in memory. In an array, we will have to move several items to keep the list in order.</li>
</ol>
<p>While drawbacks 1 and 2 above can be overcome (albeit rather awkwardly) when using arrays for stacks and queues, drawback 3 becomes a real problem when trying to use more general list structures. If we insert an item into the middle of an array, we must move several other items &ldquo;down&rdquo; the array to make room.</p>
<p>If for example, if we want to insert the number 5 into the sorted array shown below, we have to carry out several steps:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-10324d214b322b57eaf6780d323de039" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Array Insertion 0" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.3.insert0.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-10324d214b322b57eaf6780d323de039"><img alt="Array Insertion 0" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.3.insert0.png"></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Find the index of the first item whose value is greater than the number we want to insert into the array. We will call this index <code>i</code>,</li>
<li>Shift each item from index <code>i</code>  to the end of the list down one place location in the array,</li>
<li>Insert the new item into the array at index <code>i</code>, and</li>
<li>Update the index to the tail of the list.</li>
</ol>
<p>In our example, step 1 will loop through each item of the array until we find the first number in the array greater than 5. As shown below, the number 7 is found in index 3.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-c0ba9bf834e2be533fd9a69eb0d70ff4" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Array Insertion 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.3.insert1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-c0ba9bf834e2be533fd9a69eb0d70ff4"><img alt="Array Insertion 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.3.insert1.png"></a></p>
<p>Next, we will use another loop to move each item from index <code>i</code> to the end of the array down by one index number as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-74968a98ec73888447d6b030a3ca3934" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Array Insertion 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.3.insert2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-74968a98ec73888447d6b030a3ca3934"><img alt="Array Insertion 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.3.insert2.png"></a></p>
<p>Finally, we will insert our new number, 5, into the array at index 3 and increment tail to 8.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-11bd74bb776ab7da8dfc4714acbfd886" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Array Insertion 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.3.insert3.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-11bd74bb776ab7da8dfc4714acbfd886"><img alt="Array Insertion 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.3.insert3.png"></a></p>
<p>In this operation, if we have $N$ items, we either compare or move all of them, which would require $N$ operations. Of course, this operation runs in order $N$ time.</p>
<p>The same problem occurs when we remove an item from the array. In this case we must perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search the array to find the first occurrence of the desired number to remove,</li>
<li>Continue searching until we find the last occurrence of the desired number to remove,</li>
<li>Shift each item after the last occurrence of our desired number &ldquo;up&rdquo; the array, once for each desired number being removed from the array, and</li>
<li>Update the index to the tail of the list.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-more-flexible-approach">A More Flexible Approach</h2>
<p>Instead of using arrays to try to hold our lists, a more flexible approach is to build our own list data structure that relies on a set of objects that are all linked together through references to each other. In the figure below we have created a list of numbers that are linked to each other. Each object contains both the number as well as a reference to the next number in the list. Using this structure, we can search through each item in the list by starting sequentially from the beginning and performing a linear search much like we did with arrays. However, instead of explicitly keeping track of the end of the list, we use the convention that the reference in the last item of the list is set to <code>0</code>, which we call <code>null</code>. If a reference is set to <code>null</code> we interpret this to mean that there is no next item in the list. This &ldquo;linked list&rdquo; structure also makes inserting items into the middle of the list easier. All we need to do is find the location in the list where we want to insert the item and then adjust the references to include the new item into the list.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-73ecf5fbf6f0bbba3808c494ea398980" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Singly Linked List Overview" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.3.overview.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>The following figure shows a slightly more complex version of a linked list, called a &ldquo;doubly linked list&rdquo;. Instead of just having each item in the list reference the next item, it references the previous item in the list as well. The main advantage of doubly linked lists is that we can easily traverse the list in either the forward or backward direction. Doubly linked lists are useful in applications to implement undo and redo functions, and in web browser histories where we want the ability to go forward and backward in the history.</p>

<p>We will investigate each of these approaches in more detail below and will reimplement both our stack and queue operations using linked lists instead of arrays.</p>

<p>The content for singly-linked lists has been removed to shorten this chapter. Based on the discussion of doubly-linked lists below, you can probably figure out what a singly-linked list does.</p>
</div>
</div>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMF9aPVFwNo">YouTube Video</a>

<p>With singly linked lists, each node in the list had a pointer to the next node in the list. This structure allowed us to grow and shrink the list as needed and gave us the ability to insert and delete nodes at the front, middle, or end of the list. However, we often had to use two pointers when manipulating the list to allow us to access the previous node in the list as well as the current node. One way to solve this problem and make our list even more flexible is to allow a node to point at both the previous node in the list as well as the next node in the list. We call this a doubly linked list.</p>
<p>The concept of a doubly linked list is shown below. Here, each node in the list has a link to the next node and a link to the previous node. If there is no previous or next node, we set the pointers to null.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-d21474bea017e5ebf637c884515a71a2" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Doubly Linked List" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.3.double.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<h2 id="doubly-linked-node">Doubly Linked Node</h2>
<p>A doubly linked list node is the same as a singly linked list node with the addition of the <code>previous</code> attribute that points to the previous node in the list as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-2e9819775a0c0741a297e2064919024c" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Doubly Linked List Node" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.10.doublenode.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>The class representation of a doubly linked list <code>Node</code> is shown below. As discussed above, we have three attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data</code>, which holds the data of the node,</li>
<li><code>next</code>, which is a pointer to the next node, and</li>
<li><code>previous</code>, which is a pointer to the previous node.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also use a constructor and the standard <code>toString</code> operation to create a string for the data stored in the node.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-38563685df5b4618de0b9c77821ca12e" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Doubly Linked List Node UML" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/9/9.10.doublenodeuml.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<h2 id="doubly-linked-list">Doubly Linked List</h2>
<p>As with our singly linked list, we start off a doubly linked list with a pointer to the first node in the list, which we call <code>head</code>. However, if we also store the pointer to the last node in the list, we can simplify some of our insertion and removal operations as well as reduce the time complexity of operations that insert, remove, or peek at the last node in the list.</p>
<p>The figure below shows a doubly linked list with five nodes. The variable <code>head</code> points to the first node in the list, while the variable <code>tail</code> points to the last node in the list. Each node in the list now has two pointers, <code>next</code> and <code>previous</code>, which point to the appropriate node in the list. Notice that the first node&rsquo;s <code>previous</code> pointer is null, while the last node&rsquo;s <code>next</code> pointer is also null.</p>

<h2 id="doubly-linked-list-class">Doubly Linked List Class</h2>
<p>Like we did for our singly linked list, we capture the necessary details for our doubly linked list in a class. The doubly linked list class has four attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>head</code>&mdash;the pointer to the first node in the list,</li>
<li><code>tail</code>&mdash;the pointer to the last node in the list,</li>
<li><code>current</code>&mdash;the pointer to the current node used by the iterator, and</li>
<li><code>size</code>&mdash;an integer to keep track of the number of items in the list.</li>

<p>You will not be asked to implement a list iterator, but it is an interesting concept to study. Most languages that have a <code>foreach</code> loop construct use iterators behind the scenes to keep track of the current position in the list. This is also why you should not modify the structure of the list while iterating through it using a <code>foreach</code> loop.</p>

<p>An iterator is a set of operations a data structure provides to allow users to access the items in the data structure sequentially, without requiring them to know its underlying representation. There are many reasons users might want to access the data in a list. For instance, users may want to make a copy of their list or count the number of times a piece of data was stored in the list. Or, the user might want to delete all data from a list that matches a certain specification. All of these can be handled by the user using an iterator.</p>
<p>At a minimum, iterators have two operations: <code>reset</code> and <code>getNext</code>. Both of these operations use the list class&rsquo;s <code>current</code> attribute to keep track of the iterator&rsquo;s current node.</p>
<h2 id="reset">Reset</h2>
<p>The <code>reset</code> operation initializes or reinitializes the <code>current</code> pointer. It is typically used to ensure that the iterator starts at the beginning of the list. All that is required is for the <code>current</code> attribute be set to <code>null</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function reset()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  current = null
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="get-next">Get Next</h2>
<p>The main operation of the iterator is the <code>getNext</code> operation. Basically, the <code>getNext</code> operation returns the next available node in the list if one is available.  It returns <code>null</code> if the list is empty or if <code>current</code> is pointing at the last node in the list.</p>
<p>Lines 2 and 3 in the <code>getNext</code> operation check to see if we have an empty list, which results in returning the <code>null</code> value. If we have something in the list but <code>current</code> is <code>null</code>, this indicates that the <code>reset</code> operation has just been executed and we should return the data in the first node. Therefore, we set <code>current = head</code> in line 6.  Otherwise, we set the <code>current</code> pointer to point to the next node in the list in line 8.</p>

<p>Next we return the appropriate data. If <code>current == null</code> we are at the end of the list and so we return the <code>null</code> value in line 11. If <code>current</code> is not equal to <code>null</code>, then it is pointing at a node in the list, so we simply return <code>current.data</code> in line 13.</p>
<h2 id="remove-current">Remove current</h2>
<p>While not technically part of the basic iterator interface, the <code>removeCurrent</code> operation is an example of operations that can be provided to work hand-in-hand with a list iterator. The <code>removeCurrent</code> operation allows the user to utilize the iterator operations to find a specific piece of data in the list and then remove that data from the list. Other operations that might be provided include being able to replace the data in the current node, or even insert a new piece of data before or after the current node.</p>
<p>The <code>removeCurrent</code> operation starts by checking to make sure that <code>current</code> is really pointing at a node. If it is not, then the condition is caught in line 2 and an exception is raised in line 3. Next, we set the <code>next</code> pointer in the previous node to point to the current node&rsquo;s <code>next</code> pointer in lines 5 - 9, taking into account whether the current node is the first node in the list. After that, we set the next node&rsquo;s <code>previous</code> pointer to point back at the previous node in line 10 - 14, considering whether the node is the last node in the list. Finally, we decrement <code>size</code> in line 15.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function removeCurrent()

<p>There are several applications for list iterators. For our example, we will use the case where we need a function to delete all instances of data in the list that match a given piece of data. Our <code>deleteAll</code> function resides outside the <code>list</code> class, so we will have to pass in the <code>list</code> we want to delete the <code>data</code> from.
We start the operation by initializing the list iterator in line 2, followed by getting the first piece of data in the list in line 3. Next, we&rsquo;ll enter a <code>while</code> loop and stay in that loop as long as our copy of the current node in the list, <code>listData</code>, is not <code>null</code>. When it becomes <code>null</code>, we are at the end of the list and we can exit the loop and the function.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function deleteAll(list, data)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  list.reset()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  listData = list.getNext()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  while listData != null
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    if listData == data
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">      list.removeCurrent()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end if	
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    listData = list.getNext()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  end while
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once in the list, it&rsquo;s a matter of checking if our <code>listData</code> is equal to the <code>data</code> we are trying to match. If it is, we call the list&rsquo;s <code>removeCurrent</code> operation. Then, at the bottom of the list, we get the next piece of data from the list using the list iterator&rsquo;s <code>getNext</code> operation.</p>
<p>By using a list iterator and a limited set of operations on the current data in the list, we can allow list users to manipulate the list while ensuring that the integrity of the list remains intact. Since we do not know ahead of time how a list will be used in a given application, an iterator with associated operations can allow the user to use the list in application-specific ways without having to add new operations to the list data structure.</p>

<h1 id="list-based-queues">List-Based Queues</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abQW7BnD4_c">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Implementing a queue with a doubly linked list is straightforward and efficient. The core queue operations (<code>enqueue</code>, <code>dequeue</code>, <code>isEmpty</code>, and <code>peek</code>) can all be implemented by directly calling list operations that run in constant time. The only other major operation is the <code>toString</code> operation, which is also implemented by directly calling the list <code>toString</code> operation; however, it runs in order $N$ time due to the fact that the list <code>toString</code> operation must iterate through each item in the list.</p>
<p>The key queue operations and their list-based implementations are shown below.</p>

<p>Stacks can be implemented using a similar method - namely adding and removing from the end of the list. This can even be done using a singly-linked list, and is very efficient.</p>

<h1 id="lists-summary">Lists Summary</h1>

<p>In this module we looked at the stack data structure. Stacks are a &ldquo;last in first out&rdquo; data structure that use two main operations, push and pop, to put data onto the stack and to remove data off of the stack. Stacks are useful in many applications including text editor &ldquo;undo&rdquo; and web browser &ldquo;back&rdquo; functions.</p>
<p>We also saw the queue data structure. Queues are a &ldquo;first in first out&rdquo; data structure that use two main operations, enqueue and dequeue, to put data into the queue and to remove data from the queue. Queues are useful in many applications including the scheduling of tasks, sharing of resources, and processing of messages in the proper order.</p>
<p>Finally, we introduced the concept of a linked list, discussing both singly and doubly linked lists. Both kinds of lists are made up of nodes that hold data as well as references (also known as pointers) to other nodes in the list. Singly linked lists use only a single pointer, <code>next</code>, to connect each node to the next node in the list. While simple, we saw that a singly linked list allowed us to efficiently implement a stack without any artificial bounds on the number of items in the list.</p>
<p>With doubly linked lists, we added a <code>previous</code> pointer that points to the previous node. This makes the list more flexible and makes it easier to insert and remove nodes from the list. We also added a <code>tail</code> pointer to the class, which keeps track of the last node in the list. The <code>tail</code> pointer significantly increased the efficiency of working with nodes at the end of the list. Adding the <code>tail</code> pointer allowed us to implement all the major queue operations in constant time.</p>

<h1 id="introducing-recursion">Introducing Recursion</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GALIjmSovzM">YouTube Video</a>

<p>We are now used to using functions in our programs that allow us to decompose complex problems into smaller problems that are easier to solve. Now, we will look at a slight wrinkle in how we use functions. Instead of simply having functions call other functions, we now allow for the fact that a function can actually call itself! When a function calls itself, we call it <em>recursion</em>.</p>
<p>Using recursion often allows us to solve complex problems elegantly&mdash;with only a few lines of code. Recursion is an alternative to using loops and, theoretically, any function that can be solved with loops can be solved with recursion and vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="example-palindromes">Example: Palindromes</h2>
<p>So why would a function want to call itself? When we use recursive functions, we are typically trying to break the problem down into smaller versions of itself. For example, suppose we want to check to see if a word is a palindrome (i.e., it is spelled the same way forwards and backwards). How would we do this recursively? Typically, we would check to see if the first and last characters were the same. If so, we would check the rest of the word between the first and last characters. We would do this over and over until we got down to the 0 or 1 characters in the middle of the word. Let&rsquo;s look at what this might look like in pseudocode.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function isPalindrome (String S) returns Boolean
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    if length of S &lt; 2 then
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return true
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    else
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return (first character in S == last character in S) and 
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">                isPalindrome(substring of S without first and last character)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end if
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>First, we&rsquo;ll look at the <code>else</code> part of the <code>if</code> statement. Essentially, this statement determines if the first and last characters of <code>S</code> match, and then calls itself recursively to check the rest of the word <code>S</code>. Of course, if the first and last characters of <code>S</code> match and the rest of the string is a palindrome, the function will return <code>true</code>. However, we can&rsquo;t keep calling <code>isPalindrome</code> recursively forever. At some point we have to stop. That is what the <code>if</code> part of the statement does. We call this our base case. When we get to the point where the length of the string we are checking is <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> (i.e., <code>&lt; 2</code>), we know we have reached the middle of the word. Since all strings of length 0 or 1 are, by definition, palindromes, we return <code>true</code>.</p>
<h2 id="key-idea-break-up-the-problem">Key Idea: Break Up the Problem</h2>
<p>The key idea of recursion is to break the problem into simpler subproblems until you get to the point where the solution to the problem is trivial and can be solved directly; this is the base case. The algorithm design technique is a form of divide-and-conquer called <em>decrease-and-conquer</em>. In decrease-and-conquer, we reduce our problem into smaller versions of the larger problem.</p>
<p>A recursive program is broken into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>base case</strong>&mdash;a simple version of the problem that can be solved directly, and</li>
<li>a <strong>recursive case</strong>&mdash;a general solution to the problem that uses smaller versions of the problem to compute the solution to the larger problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>The base case is generally the final case we consider in a recursive function and serves to both end the recursive calls and to start the process of returning the final answer to our problem. To avoid endless cycles of recursive calls, it is imperative that we check to ensure that:</p>
<ol>
<li>a base case exists where no further recursive calls are made, and</li>
<li>it is possible to reach the base case; the recursive case must ensure that we are moving closer to the base case with each recursive call.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="example-reversing-a-string">Example: Reversing a String</h1>

<p>Suppose we must write a program that reads in a sequence of keyboard characters and prints them in reverse order. The user ends the sequence by typing an asterisk character <code>*</code>.</p>
<p>We could solve this problem using an array, but since we do not know how many characters might be entered before the <code>*</code>, we could not be sure the program would actually work. However, we can use a recursive function since its ability to save the input data is not limited by a predefined array size.</p>
<p>Our solution would look something like this. We&rsquo;ve also numbered the lines to make the following discussion easier to understand.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-py" data-lang="py"><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 1</span><span class="cl"><span class="n">function</span> <span class="n">REVERSE</span><span class="p">()</span>

<h2 id="base-case">Base Case</h2>
<p>The function first reads a single character from the keyboard and stores it in <code>CHARACTER</code>. Then, in line 3 it checks to see if the user typed the <code>*</code> character. If so, we simply return, knowing that we have reached the end of the input and need to start printing out the characters we&rsquo;ve read in reverse order. This is the <em>base case</em> for this recursive function.</p>
<h2 id="recursive-case">Recursive Case</h2>
<p>If the <code>CHARACTER</code> we read in was not an <code>*</code>, line 6 will recursively call <code>REVERSE</code> to continue reading characters. Once the function returns (meaning that we have gotten an <code>*</code> character and started the return process) the function prints the <code>CHARACTER</code> in line 7 and then returns itself.</p>
<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at what happens within the computer when we run <code>REVERSE</code>. Let&rsquo;s say the program user wants to enter the three characters from the keyboard: <code>n</code>, <code>o</code>, and <code>w</code> followed by the <code>*</code> character. The following figure illustrates the basic concept of what is going on in the computer.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-f9637d1dc2d61fe5c339b2612ec0d959" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Reverse Head Recursive Activation Stack" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/6/6.2.reverse-head.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-f9637d1dc2d61fe5c339b2612ec0d959"><img alt="Reverse Head Recursive Activation Stack" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/6/6.2.reverse-head.png"></a></p>
<p>The arrows in the figure represent the order of execution of the statements in the computer. Each time we execute the recursive call to <code>REVERSE</code> in line 6, we create a new instance of the function, which starts its execution back at the beginning of the function (line 2). Then, when the function executes <code>return</code>, control reverts back to the next statement to be executed (line 7) in the calling instance of the function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that each instance of the function has its own set of variables whose values are unique to that instance. When we read <code>n</code> into the <code>CHARACTER</code> variable in the first instance of <code>REVERSE</code> it is not affected by anything that happens in the second instance of <code>REVERSE</code>.  Therefore, reading the <code>o</code> into <code>CHARACTER</code> in the second instance of <code>REVERSE</code> does not affect the value of <code>CHARACTER</code> in the first instance of <code>REVERSE</code>.</p>
<p>During the execution of the first instance of <code>REVERSE</code>, the user enters the character <code>n</code> so the <code>if</code> condition is <code>false</code> and we execute the <code>else</code> part of the statement, which calls the <code>REVERSE</code> function. (Note that before we actually start the second instance of <code>REVERSE</code>, the operating system stores the statement where we will pick up execution once the called function returns.) When the second instance of <code>REVERSE</code> is started, a new copy of all variables is created as well to ensure we do not overwrite the values from the first instance.</p>
<p>The execution of the second instance of  <code>REVERSE</code> runs exactly like the first instance except that the user enters the character <code>o</code> instead of <code>n</code>. Again, the <code>else</code> part of the <code>if</code> statement is executed, which calls the <code>REVERSE</code> function. When the third instance of <code>REVERSE</code> is executed, the user now inputs <code>w</code>, which again causes a new instance of <code>REVERSE</code> to be called.</p>
<p>Finally, in the fourth instance of <code>REVERSE</code>, the user inputs the <code>*</code> character, which causes the <code>if</code> part of the statement to execute, which performs our <code>return</code> statement. Once the <code>return</code> from the base case of our recursive function is performed, it starts the process of ending all the instances of the <code>REVERSE</code> function and creating the solution. When instance 4 of the <code>REVERSE</code> function returns, execution starts at the <code>write</code> statement (line 7) of instance 3. Here the character <code>w</code> is printed, and the function returns to instance 2. The same process is carried out in instance 2, which prints the <code>o</code> character and returns. Likewise, instance 1 prints its character <code>n</code> and then returns. The screen should now show the full output of the original call to <code>REVERSE</code> , which is &ldquo;won&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Recursion has allowed us to create a very simple and elegant solution to the problem of reversing an arbitrary number of characters. While you can do this in a non-recursive way using loops, the solution is not that simple. If you don&rsquo;t believe us, just try it! (Yes, that is a challenge.)</p>

<p>The <code>REVERSE2</code> function in the previous quiz actually prints the characters entered by the user in the same order in which they are typed. Notice how this small variation in the instruction order significantly changed the outcome of the function. To get a better understanding of why this occurs, we will delve into the order of execution in a little more depth.</p>
<h2 id="head-and-tail-recursion">Head and Tail Recursion</h2>
<p>From the output of our original <code>REVERSE</code> function, we could argue that recursive function calls are carried out in a LIFO (last in, first out) order. Conversely, the output of the second version of the function <code>REVERSE2</code>, would lead us to believe that recursive function calls are carried out in FIFO (first in, first out) order. However, the ordering of the output is really based on how we structure our code within the recursive function itself, not the order of execution of the recursive functions.</p>
<p>To produce a LIFO ordering, we use a method called <em>head recursion</em>, which causes the function to make a recursive call first, then calculates the results once the recursive call returns. To produce a FIFO ordering, we use a method called <em>tail recursion</em>, which is when the function makes all of its necessary calculations before making a recursive call. With the <code>REVERSE</code> and <code>REVERSE2</code> functions, this is simply a matter of swapping lines 6 and 7.</p>
<p>While some functions require the use of either head or tail recursion, many times we have the choice of which one to use. The choice is not necessarily just a matter of style, as we shall see next.</p>
<h2 id="tracing-program-execution">Tracing Program Execution</h2>
<p>Before we finish our discussion of head and tail recursion, we need to make sure we understand how a recursive function actually works in the computer. To do this, we will use a new example. Let&rsquo;s assume we want to print all numbers from 0 to $N$, where $N$ is provided as a parameter. A recursive solution to this problem is shown below.</p>

<p>Notice that we have added some extra <code>print</code> statements (lines 5 and 7) to the function just to help us keep track of when we have called <code>OUTPUT</code> and when that call has returned. This function is very similar to the <code>REVERSE</code> function above, we just don&rsquo;t have to worry about reading a character each time the function runs. Now, if we call <code>OUTPUT</code> with an initial parameter of <code>3</code>, we get the following output. We&rsquo;ve also marked these lines with letters to make the following discussion simpler.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Calling to OUTPUT 2         (a)

<p>Once we get to the call of <code>OUTPUT(0)</code>, the function prints out <code>0</code> (line d) and we start the return process. When we return from the call to <code>OUTPUT(0)</code> we immediately print out <code>N</code>, which is <code>1</code> and return. We continue this return process from lines g through j and eventually return from the original call to <code>OUTPUT</code> having completed the task.</p>
<h2 id="looking-under-the-covers">Looking Under the Covers</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen how recursion works in practice, we will pull back the covers and take a quick look at what is going on underneath. To be able to call the same function over and over, we need to be able to store the appropriate data related to each function call to ensure we can treat it as a unique instance of the function. While we do not make copies of the code, we do need to make copies of other data. Specifically, when function <code>A</code> calls function <code>B</code>, we must save the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>the memory address of the current parameters,</li>
<li>the address of the statement in function <code>A</code> to be executed when <code>B</code> returns (called the <em>return address</em>),</li>
<li>the address of the memory location that will contain the value returned by the function (the <em>value address</em>), and</li>
<li>all the local variables of function <code>B</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We call this information the <em>activation record</em> for function <code>A</code>. When a call to <code>B</code> is made, this information is stored in a stack data structure known as the <em>activation stack</em>, and execution begins at the first instruction in function <code>B</code>. Upon completion of function <code>B</code>, the following steps are performed.</p>
<ol>
<li>The return address is read from the activation stack.</li>
<li>The information stored about function B is removed from the activation stack, leaving the information stored for function A on top of the stack.</li>
<li>Execution begins at the return address in function A.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, we will look at how we use the activation stack to implement recursion. For this we will use a simple <code>MAIN</code> program that calls our simplified <code>OUTPUT</code> function (where we have removed all the print statements used to track our progress).</p>

<p>When we run <code>MAIN</code>, the only record on the activation stack is the record for <code>MAIN</code>. Since it has not been &ldquo;called&rdquo; from another function, it does not contain a return address. It also has no local variables, so the record is basically empty as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-8c74d1c95ddb982e87dd11c89f2d2634" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Main Activation Record" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/6/6.4.mainstack.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>However, when we execute line 2 in <code>MAIN</code>, we call the function <code>OUTPUT</code> with a parameter of <code>3</code>. This causes the creation of a new function activation record with the return address of line 3 in the calling <code>MAIN</code> function and a parameter for <code>N</code>, which is <code>3</code>. Again, there are no local variables in <code>OUTPUT</code>. The stack activation is shown in figure <strong>a</strong> below.</p>

<p>Following the execution for <code>OUTPUT</code>, we will eventually make our recursive call to <code>OUTPUT</code> in line 10, which creates a new activation record on the stack as shown above in <strong>b</strong>. This time, the return address will be line 11 and the parameter <code>N</code> is <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>Execution of the second instance of <code>OUTPUT</code> will follow the first instance, eventually resulting in another recursive call to <code>OUTPUT</code> and a new activation record as shown in <strong>c</strong> above. Here the return address is again <code>5</code> but now the value of parameter <code>N</code> is <code>1</code>.  Execution of the third instance of <code>OUTPUT</code> yields similar results, giving us another activation record on the stack <strong>d</strong> with the value of parameter <code>N</code> being <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, the execution of the fourth instance of <code>OUTPUT</code> will reach our base case of <code>N == 0</code>. Here we will <code>write 0</code> in line 8 and then <code>return</code>.

<p>When execution begins in the third instance of <code>OUTPUT</code> at line 11, we again write the current value of <code>N</code>, which is <code>1</code>, and we then <code>return</code>. We follow this same process, returning to the second instance of <code>OUTPUT</code>, then the first instance of <code>OUTPUT</code>. Once the initial instance of <code>OUTPUT</code> completes, it returns to line 3 in <code>MAIN</code>, where the <code>print(&quot;Done&quot;)</code> statement is executed and <code>MAIN</code> ends.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>While recursion is a very powerful technique, its expressive power has an associated cost in terms of both time and space. Anytime we call a function, a certain amount of memory space is needed to store information on the activation stack. In addition, the process of calling a function takes extra time since we must store parameter values and the return address, etc. before restarting execution. In the general case, a recursive function will take more time and more memory than a similar function computed using loops.</p>
<h2 id="recursion-versus-iteration">Recursion Versus Iteration</h2>
<p>It is possible to demonstrate that any function with a recursive structure can be transformed into an iterative function that uses loops and vice versa. It is also important to know how to use both mechanisms because there are advantages and disadvantages for both iterative and recursive solutions. While we&rsquo;ve discussed the fact that loops are typically faster and take less memory than similar recursive solutions, it is also true that recursive solutions are generally more elegant and easier to understand. Recursive functions can also allow us to find solutions to problems that are complex to write using loops.</p>

<h1 id="example-factorials">Example: Factorials</h1>

<p>The most popular example of using recursion is calculating the factorial of a positive integer $N$. The factorial of a positive integer $N$ is just the product of all the integers from $1$ to $N$. For example, the factorial of $5$, written as $5!$, is calculated as $5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120$. The definition of the factorial function itself is recursive.</p>
$$
\text{fact}(N) = N  *  \text{fact}(N - 1)
$$
<p>The corresponding pseudocode is shown below.</p>

<h1 id="tree-recursion">Tree Recursion</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6rXXaVx7DU">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In the previous examples we saw recursive functions that call themselves one time within the code. This type of recursion is called <em>linear recursion</em>, where head and tail recursion are two specific types of linear recursion.</p>
<p>In this section we will investigate another type of recursion called <em>tree recursion</em>, which occurs when a function calls itself two or more times to solve a single problem. To illustrate tree recursion, we will use a simple recursive function <code>MAX</code>, which finds the maximum of $N$ elements in an array. To calculate the maximum of $N$ elements we will use the following recursive algorithm.</p>
<ol>
<li>Compute the maximum of the first $N/2$ elements and store in <code>MAX1</code>.</li>
<li>Compute the maximum of the last $N/2$ elements and store in <code>MAX2</code>.</li>
<li>Compare <code>MAX1</code> and <code>MAX2</code> to find the maximum of all elements.</li>

<p>Our process recursively decomposes the problem by searching for the maximum in the first $N/2$ elements and the second $N/2$ elements until we reach the base case. In this problem, the base case is when we either have 1 or 2 elements in the array. If we just have 1, we return that value. If we have 2, we return the larger of those two values. An overview of the process is shown below.</p>

<h1 id="example-fibonacci-numbers">Example: Fibonacci Numbers</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw_SJrtYI88">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Next, we will look at calculating Fibonacci numbers using a tree recursive algorithm. Fibonacci numbers are given by the following recursive formula.</p>
$$
f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}
$$
<p>Notice that Fibonacci numbers are defined recursively, so they should be a perfect application of tree recursion! However, there are cases where recursive functions are too inefficient compared to an iterative version to be of practical use. This typically happens when the recursive solutions to a problem end up solving the same subproblems multiple times. Fibonacci numbers are a great example of this phenomenon.</p>
<h2 id="calculating-fibonacci-numbers">Calculating Fibonacci Numbers</h2>
<p>To complete the definition, we need to specify the base case, which includes two values for the first two Fibonacci numbers: <code>FIB(0) = 0</code> and <code>FIB(1) = 1</code>. The first Fibonacci numbers are $0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 …$.</p>
<p>Producing the code for finding Fibonacci numbers is very easy from its definition. The extremely simple and elegant solution to computing Fibonacci numbers recursively is shown below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>function FIB(N)
    if N == 0
        return 0
    else if N == 1
        return 1
    else
        return FIB(N-1) + FIB(N-2)
    end if
end function</code></pre></div><p>The following pseudocode performs the same calculations for the iterative version.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>function FIBIT(N)
    FIB1 = 1
    FIB2 = 0
    for (I = 2 to N)
        FIB = FIB1 + FIB2
        FIB2 = FIB1
        FIB1 = FIB
    end loop
end function</code></pre></div><p>While this function is not terribly difficult to understand, there is still quite a bit of mental gymnastics required to see how this implements the computation of Fibonacci numbers and even more to prove that it does so correctly. However, as we will see later, the performance improvements of the iterative solution are worth it.</p>
<p>If we analyze the computation required for the 6th Fibonacci number in both the iterative and recursive algorithms, the truth becomes evident. The recursive algorithm calculates the 5th Fibonacci number by recursively calling <code>FIB(4)</code> and <code>FIB(3)</code>. In turn, <code>FIB(4)</code> calls <code>FIB(3)</code> and <code>FIB(2)</code>. Notice that <code>FIB(3)</code> is actually calculated twice! This is a problem. If we calculate the 36th Fibonacci number, the values of many Fibonacci numbers are calculated repeatedly, over and over.</p>
<h2 id="tracing-the-program">Tracing the Program</h2>
<p>To clarify our ideas further, we can consider the recursive tree resulting from the trace of the program to calculate the 6th Fibonacci number. Each of the computations highlighted in the diagram will have been computed previously.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-fcb8c0abb8c0bb7613eda8165f613fae" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Fibonacci Tree Recursion" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/6/6.8.fib1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-fcb8c0abb8c0bb7613eda8165f613fae"><img alt="Fibonacci Tree Recursion" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/6/6.8.fib1.png"></a></p>
<p>If we count the recomputations, we can see how we calculate the 4th Fibonacci number twice, the 3rd Fibonacci number three times, and the 2nd Fibonacci five times. All of this is due to the fact the we do not consider the work done by other recursive calls. Furthermore, the higher our initial number, the worse the situation grows, and at a very rapid pace.</p>
<h2 id="memoization">Memoization</h2>
<p>To avoid recomputing the same Fibonacci number multiple times, we can save the results of various calculations and reuse them directly instead of recomputing them. This technique is called <em>memoization</em>, which can be used to optimize some functions that use tree recursion.</p>
<p>To implement memoization, we simply store the values the first time we compute them in an array. The following pseudocode shows an efficient algorithm that uses an array, called <code>FA</code>, to store and reuse Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function FIBOPT(N)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    if N == 0
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return 0
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    else if N == 1
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return 1
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    else if FA[N] == -1

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    else
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return FA[N]
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end if
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We assume that each element in <code>FA</code> has been initialized to <code>-1</code>. We also assume that <code>N</code> is greater than <code>0</code> and that the length of <code>FA</code> is larger than the Fibonacci number <code>N</code> that we are trying to compute. (Of course, we would normally put these assumptions in our precondition; however, since we are focusing on the recursive nature of the function, we will not explicitly show this for now.) The cases where <code>N == 0</code> and <code>N == 1</code> are the same as we saw in our previous <code>FIB</code> function. There is no need to store these values in the array when we can return them directly, since storing them in the array takes additional time. The interesting cases are the last two. First, we check to see if <code>FA[N] == -1</code>, which would indicate that we have not computed the Fibonacci number for <code>N</code> yet. If we have not yet computed <code>N</code>&rsquo;s Fibonacci number, we recursively call <code>FIBOPT(N-1)</code> and <code>FIBOPT(N-2)</code> to compute its value and then store it in the array and return it. If, however, we have already computed the Fibonacci for <code>N</code> (i.e., if <code>FA[N]</code> is not equal to <code>-1</code>), then we simply return the value stored in the array, <code>FA[N]</code>.</p>
<p>As shown in our original call tree below, using the <code>FIBOPT</code> function, none of the function calls in red will be made at all. While the function calls in yellow will be made, they will simply return a precomputed value from the <code>FA</code> array. Notice that for <code>N = 6</code>, we save 14 of the original 25 function calls required for the <code>FIB</code> function, or a $56\%$ savings. As <code>N</code> increases, the savings grow even more.</p>

<h1 id="example-tower-of-hanoi">Example: Tower of Hanoi</h1>

<p>There are some problems where an iterative solution is difficult to implement and is not always immediately intuitive, while a recursive solution is simple, concise and easy to understand. A classic example is the problem of the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi" rel="external" target="_blank">Tower of Hanoi</a></em>.</p>
<p>The Tower of Hanoi is a game that lends itself to a recursive solution. Suppose we have three towers on which we can put discs. The three towers are indicated by a letter, A, B, or C.</p>
<p>Now, suppose we have $N$ discs all of different sizes. The discs are stacked on tower A based on their size, smaller discs on top. The problem is to move all the discs from one tower to another by observing the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>we can move only one disc at a time, and we must move the disc that is at the top of a tower first, and</li>
<li>a larger disc can never be put on top of a smaller disc.</li>
</ol>
<p>To try to solve the problem let&rsquo;s start by considering a simple case: we want to move two discs from tower A to tower C. As a convenience, suppose we number the discs in ascending order by assigning the number 1 to the larger disc. The solution in this case is simple and consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>move disc 2 from tower A to tower B,</li>
<li>move disc 1 from tower A to tower C, and</li>
<li>move disc 2 from Tower B to tower C.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following figure shows how the algorithm works.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-13c65990a8aebe80610d4cabb8665e9d" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Tower of Hanoi" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/6/6.9.tower.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-13c65990a8aebe80610d4cabb8665e9d"><img alt="Tower of Hanoi" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/6/6.9.tower.png"></a></p>
<p>It is a little more difficult with three discs, but after a few tries the proper algorithm emerges. With our knowledge of recursion, we can come up with a simple and concise solution. Since we already know how to move two discs from one place to another, we can solve the problem recursively.</p>
<ol>
<li>Move discs 3 and 2 from tower A to B.</li>
<li>Move disc 1 from tower A to C.</li>
<li>Move discs 3 and 2 from tower B to C.</li>
</ol>
<p>In formulating our solution, we assumed that we could move two discs from one tower to another, since we have already solved that part of the problem above. In step 1, we use this solution to move the top two discs from tower A to B. Then, in step 3, we again use that solution to move two discs from tower B to C.
This process can now easily be generalized to the case of N discs as described below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Move the first N-1 discs from tower A to B.</li>
<li>Move disc 1 from tower A to C.</li>
<li>Move N -1 discs from tower B to C.</li>
</ol>
<p>The algorithm is captured in the following pseudocode. Here <code>N</code> is the total number of discs, <code>ORIGIN</code> is the tower where the discs are currently located, and <code>DESTINATION</code> is the tower where they need to be moved. Finally, <code>TEMP</code> is a temporary tower we can use to help with the move. All the parameters are integers.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function HANOI(N, ORIGIN, DESTINATION, TEMP)

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    return
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The function moves the $N$ discs from the source tower to the destination tower using a temporary tower. To do this, it calls itself to move the first $N-1$ discs from the source tower to the temporary tower. It then moves the bottom disc from the source tower to the destination tower. The function then moves the $N-1$ discs present in the temporary tower into the destination tower.</p>
<p>The list of movements to solve the three-disc problem is shown below.</p>
<ol>
<li>move disc 3 from ORIGIN to DESTINATION</li>
<li>move disc 2 from ORIGIN to TEMP</li>
<li>move disc 3 from DESTINATION to TEMP</li>
<li>move disc 1 from ORIGIN to DESTINATION</li>
<li>move disc 3 from TEMP to ORIGIN</li>
<li>move disc 2 from TEMP to DESTINATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Iterative solutions to the Tower of Hanoi problem do exist, but it took many researchers several years to find an efficient solution. The simplicity of finding the recursive solution presented here should convince you that recursion is an approach you should definitely keep in your bag of tricks!</p>

<h1 id="converting-recursion-to-iteration">Converting Recursion to Iteration</h1>

<p>Iteration and recursion have the same expressive power, which means that any problem that has a recursive solution also has an iterative solution and vice versa. There are also standard techniques that allow you to transform a recursive program into an equivalent iterative version. The simplest case is for tail recursion, where the recursive call is the last step in the function. There are two cases of tail recursion to consider when converting to an iterative version.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the recursive function does not have any parameters or the parameters are passed by reference, the conversion is very simple. We just use a simple while loop.</li>
<li>If the recursive function uses parameters passed by value, the conversion is a little more complicated. In general, if the last statement a function <code>f(x)</code> executes is a call to itself, <code>f(y)</code> with parameter <code>y</code>, the recursive call can be replaced by an assignment statement, <code>x = y</code>, and by looping back to the beginning of function <code>f</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The approach above only solves the conversion problem in the case of tail recursion. However, as an example, consider our original <code>FACT</code> function and its iterative version <code>FACT2</code>. Notice that in <code>FACT2</code> we had to add a variable <code>fact</code> to keep track of the actual computation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function FACT(N)

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The conversion of non-tail recursive functions typically uses two loops to iterate through the process, effectively replacing recursive calls. The first loop executes statements before the original recursive call, while the second loop executes the statements after the original recursive call. The process also requires that we use a stack to save the parameter and local variable values each time through the loop. Within the first loop, all the statements that precede the recursive call are executed, and then, before the loop terminates, the values of interest are pushed onto the stack. The second loop starts by popping the values saved on the stack and then executing the remaining statements that come after the original recursive call. This is typically much more difficult than the conversion process for tail recursion.</p>

<h1 id="recursion-summary">Recursion Summary</h1>

<p>In this module, we explored the use of <em>recursion</em> to write concise solutions for a variety of problems. Recursion allows us to call a function from within itself, using either <em>head recursion</em>, <em>tail recursion</em> or <em>tree recursion</em> to solve smaller instances of the original problem.</p>
<p>Recursion requires a <em>base case</em>, which tells our function when to stop calling itself and start returning values, and a <em>recursive case</em> to handle reducing the problem&rsquo;s size and calling the function again, sometimes multiple times.</p>
<p>We can use recursion in many different ways, and any problem that can be solved iteratively can also be solved recursively. The power in recursion comes from its simplicity in code&mdash;some problems are much easier to solve recursively than iteratively.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in general a recursive solution requires more computation time and memory than an iterative solution. We can use techniques such as <em>memoization</em> to greatly improve the time it takes for a recursive function to execute, especially in the case of calculating Fibonacci numbers where subproblems are overlapped.</p>

<h1 id="searching">Searching</h1>

<p>In this course, we are learning about many different ways we can store data in our programs, using arrays, queues, stacks, lists, maps, and more. We&rsquo;ve already covered a few of these data structures, and we&rsquo;ll learn about the others in upcoming modules. Before we get there, we should also look at a couple of the most important operations we can perform on those data structures.</p>
<p>Consider the classic example of a data structure containing information about students in a school. In the simplest case, we could use an array to store objects created from a <code>Student</code> class, each one representing a single student in the school.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen before, we can easily create those objects and store them in our array. We can even iterate through the array to find the maximum age or minimum GPA of all the students in our school.
However, what if we want to just find a single student&rsquo;s information? To do that, we&rsquo;ll need to discuss one of the most commonly used data structure operations: searching.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-searching">What is Searching?</h2>
<p>Searching typically involves finding a piece of information, or a value stored in a data structure or calculated within a specific domain. For example, we might want to find out if a specific word is found in an array of character strings. We might also want to find an integer that meets a specific criterion, such as finding an integer that is the sum of the two preceding integers. For this module, we will focus on finding values in data structures.</p>
<p>In general, we can search for</p>
<ol>
<li>a specific value,</li>
<li>a sequence of values, or</li>
<li>values with specific properties such as the minimum or maximum value.</li>
</ol>
<p>The data structure can be thought of more generally as a container, which can be</p>
<ol>
<li>one dimensional, such as a list or a one-dimensional array,</li>
<li>multi-dimensional, such as a two-dimensional array or a matrix, or</li>
<li>a problem-specific data structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the examples in this module, we&rsquo;ll generally use a simple finite array as our container. However, it shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult to figure out how to expand these examples to work with a larger variety of data structures. In fact, as we introduce more complex data structures in this course, we&rsquo;ll keep revisiting the concept of searching and see how it applies to the new structure.</p>
<p>In general, containers can be either ordered or unordered. In many cases, we may also use the term <em>sorted</em> to refer to an ordered container, but technically an ordered container just enforces <em>an</em> ordering on values, but they may not be in a sorted order. As long as we understand what the ordering is, we can use that to our advantage, as we&rsquo;ll see later.</p>
<p>Searches in an unordered container generally require a <em>linear search</em>, where every value in the container must be compared against our search value. On the other hand, search algorithms on ordered containers can take advantage of this ordering to make their searches more efficient. A good example of this is <em>binary search</em>. Let&rsquo;s begin by looking at the simplest case, linear search.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V75q4CnlXw">YouTube Video</a>

<p>When searching for a number in an unordered array, our search algorithms are typically designed as functions that take two parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>the number to find, and</li>
<li>the array to search.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our search functions then return an index to the number within the array.</p>
<p>In this module, we will develop a couple of examples of searching an array for a specific number.</p>
<p>Finding the first occurrence of a number in an unordered array is a fairly straightforward process. A black box depiction of this function is shown below. There are two inputs, <code>array</code> and <code>number</code>, and a single output, the <code>index</code> of the first occurrence of the <code>number</code> in <code>array</code>.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-91786f0aebcd973315d411e831a60167" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Function Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.2.function.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-91786f0aebcd973315d411e831a60167"><img alt="Function Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.2.function.png"></a></p>
<p>We can also include the search function as a method inside of the container itself. In that case, we don’t have to accept the container as a parameter, since the method will know to refer to the object it is part of.</p>
<p>Of course, when we begin designing an algorithm for our function we should think about two items immediately: the preconditions and the postconditions of the function. For this function, they are fairly simple.</p>
<p>The precondition for <code>find</code> is that the <code>number</code> provided as input is compatible with the type of data held by the provided <code>array</code>. In this case, we have no real stipulations on <code>array</code>. It does not need to actually have any data in it, nor does it have to be ordered or unordered.</p>
<p>Our postcondition is also straightforward. The function should return the index of <code>number</code> if it exists in the array. However, if <code>number</code> is not found in the array, then <code>-1</code> is returned. Depending on how we wish to implement this function, it could also return another default index or throw an exception if the desired value is not found. However, most searching algorithms follow the convention of returning an invalid index of <code>-1</code> when the value is not found in the array, so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll use in our examples.</p>
<p><strong>Preconditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The number to be searched for is compatible with data in the array</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Postconditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The function returns the index of number in the array</li>
<li>The function returns -1 if the number to be searched for is not found in the array</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="searching-for-a-value">Searching for a Value</h1>

<p>To search for a single number in our array, we will use a loop to search each location in the array until we find the number. The general idea is to iterate over all the elements in the array until we either find the number we are searching for or there are no other elements in the array.</p>

<p>As we can see in line 1, the function takes both a <code>number</code> and <code>array</code> parameter. We then enter a <code>for</code> loop in line 2 to loop through each location in the array. We keep track of the current location in the array using the <code>index</code> variable. For each location, we compare <code>number</code> against the value in the <code>array</code> at location <code>index</code>. If we find the number, we simply return the value of <code>index</code> in line 4.  If we do not find the number anywhere in the array, the loop will exit, and the function will return <code>-1</code> in line 8.</p>
<p>Below is an example of how to execute this algorithm on example data.  Step 1 shows the initial state of the variables in the function the first time through the loop. Both <code>array</code> and <code>number</code> are passed to the function but we do not modify either of them in the function. The <code>index</code> variable is the <code>for</code> loop variable, which is initially set to <code>0</code> the first time through the loop. In line 3, the function compares the number in <code>array[index]</code> against the value of <code>number</code>. In this step, since <code>index</code> is <code>0</code>, we use <code>array[0]</code>, which is <code>8</code>. Since <code>8</code> is not equal to the value of <code>number</code>, which is <code>3</code>, we do nothing in the <code>if</code> statement and fall to the <code>end for</code> statement in line 6. Of course, this just sends us back to the <code>for</code> statement in line 2.</p>
<p>The second time through the <code>for</code> loop is shown as Step 2 in the figure. We follow the same logic as above and compare <code>array[1]</code>, or 4, against <code>number</code>, which is still 3. Since these values are not equal, we skip the rest of the <code>if</code> statement and move on to Step 3.</p>
<p>In Step 3, <code>index</code> is incremented to <code>2</code>, thus pointing at <code>array[2]</code>, whose value is <code>3</code>. Since this value is equal to the value of <code>number</code>, we carry out the <code>if</code> part of the statement. Line 4 returns the value of <code>2</code>, which is the first location in <code>array</code> that holds the value of <code>number</code>.</p>

<h1 id="searching-for-the-last-value">Searching for the Last Value</h1>

<p>Our <code>find</code> algorithm above will find the first instance of <code>number</code> in the <code>array</code> and return the index of that instance. However, we might also be interested in finding the last instance of <code>number</code> in <code>array</code>. Looking at our original <code>find</code> algorithm, it should be easy to find the last value by simply searching the array in reverse order, as shown in the following figure.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-adeba5124a8e2dd91e67bfbccd07f9c6" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Linear Search Last Value" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.4.linearreverse.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-adeba5124a8e2dd91e67bfbccd07f9c6"><img alt="Linear Search Last Value" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.4.linearreverse.png"></a></p>
<p>We will use the same example as above, except we will start searching backwards from the end of the array. In Step 1, we see that <code>index</code> is initialized to 7 and we compare <code>array[7]</code> against <code>number</code>, which are not the same. Thus, we continue to Step 2, where we decrement <code>index</code> to 6. Here <code>array[6]</code> is still not equal to <code>number</code>, so we continue in the loop. Finally, in Step 3, we decrement <code>index</code> to 5. Now <code>array[5]</code> contains the number <code>3</code>, which is equal to our <code>number</code> and we return the current <code>index</code> value.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, we can change our <code>for</code> loop index to decrement from the end of the array (<code>size of array - 1</code>) to the beginning (<code>0</code>). Thus, by simply changing line 3 in our original function, we can create a new function that searches for the last instance of <code>number</code> in <code>array</code>. The new function is shown below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-py" data-lang="py"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl"><span class="n">function</span> <span class="n">REVERSEFIND</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NUMBER</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ARRAY</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Obviously, the <code>for</code> loop in line 2 holds the key to searching our array in reverse order. We start at the end of the array by using the index <code>size of array - 1</code> and then decrement the value of <code>index</code> (via the <code>step -1</code> qualifier) each time through the loop until we reach 0. The remainder of the function works exactly like the <code>find</code> function.</p>

<h1 id="recursive-linear-search">Recursive Linear Search</h1>

<p>We looked at an iterative version of the <code>find</code> function above. But what would it take to turn that function into a recursive function? While for this particular function, there is not a lot to be gained from the recursive version, it is still instructive to see how we would do it. We will find recursive functions more useful later on in the module.</p>
<p>In this case, to implement a recursive version of the function, we need to add a third parameter, <code>index</code>, to tell us where to check in the array. We assume that at the beginning of a search, <code>index</code> begins at 0. Then, if <code>number</code> is not in location <code>index</code> in the <code>array</code>, <code>index</code> will be incremented before making another recursive call. Of course, if <code>number</code> is in location <code>index</code>, we will return the number of <code>index</code>. The pseudocode for the <code>findR</code> function is shown below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-py" data-lang="py"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl"><span class="n">function</span> <span class="n">FINDR</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NUMBER</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ARRAY</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">INDEX</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>First, we check to see if <code>index</code> has moved beyond the bounds of the array, which would indicate that we have searched all the locations in <code>array</code> for <code>number</code>. If that is the case, then we return <code>-1</code> in line 3 indicating that we did not find <code>number</code> in <code>array</code>. Next, we check to see if <code>number</code> is found in <code>array[index]</code> in line 4. If it is, the we are successful and return the index. However, if we are not finished searching and we have not found <code>number</code>, then we recursively call <code>findR</code> and increment <code>index</code> by 1 to search the next location.</p>
<p>An example of using the <code>findR</code> function is shown below. The top half of the figure shows the state of the data in the initial call to the <code>findR</code> function (instance 1). The bottom half of the figure shows the recursive path through the function. The beginning of instance 1 shows the <code>if</code> statement in line 2. In instance 1, since we have not searched the entire array (line 2) and <code>array[0]</code> is not equal to <code>number</code> (line 4), we fall down to the <code>else</code> part function and execute line 7, the recursive call. Since <code>index</code> is <code>0</code> in instance 1, we call instance 2 of the function with an <code>index</code> of 1.</p>
<p>In instance 2, the same thing happens as in instance 1 and we fall down to the <code>else</code> part of the <code>if</code> statement. Once again, we call a new instance of <code>findR</code>, this time with <code>index</code> set at 2. Now, in instance 3, <code>array[index]</code> is equal to <code>number</code> in line 4 and so we execute the <code>return index</code> statement in line 5.  The value of <code>index</code> (2) is returned to instance 2, which, in line 7, simply returns the value of 2 to instance 1. Again, in line 7, instance 1 returns that same value (2) to the original calling function.</p>

<p>Notice that the actual process of searching the array is the same for both the iterative and recursive functions. It is only the implementation of that process that is different between the two.</p>

<h1 id="searching-for-a-minimum">Searching for a Minimum</h1>

<p>We may also want to search through a data structure to find an item with a specific property. For example, we could search for the student with the maximum age, or the minimum GPA. For this example, let&rsquo;s consider the case where we&rsquo;d like to find the minimum value in an array of integers.</p>
<p>Searching for the minimum number in an unordered array is a different problem than searching for a specific number. First of all, we do not know what number we are searching for. And, since the array is not ordered, we will have to check each and every number in the array.</p>
<p>The input parameters of our new function will be different from the <code>find</code> function above, since we do not have a number to search for. In this case, we only have an array of numbers as an input parameter. The output parameter, however, is the same. We still want to return the index of the minimum number in the array. In this case, we will return <code>-1</code> if there is no minimum number, which can only happen if there is no data in the array when we begin.</p>
<p><strong>Preconditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The data in the array can be sorted</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Postconditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The function returns the minimum number of the data in the array</li>
<li>The function returns -1 if the array is empty</li>
</ul>
<p>Our preconditions and postconditions are also simple. Our precondition is simply that we have an array whose data can be sorted. This is important, because it means that we can compare two elements in the array and determine which one has a smaller value. Otherwise, we couldn&rsquo;t determine the minimum value at all!</p>
<p>Our postcondition is that we return the minimum number of the data in the array, or <code>-1</code> if the array is empty.</p>
<p>The function <code>findMin</code> is shown below. First, we check to see if the array is empty. If it is, we simply return <code>-1</code> in line 3. If not, we assume the location <code>0</code> contains the minimum number in the array, and set <code>min</code> equal to 0 in line 5. Then we loop through each location in the array (starting with 1) in line 6 and set <code>min</code> equal to the minimum of the array data at the current <code>index</code>  and the data at <code>min</code>. (Note: if the array only has a single number in it, the for loop will not actually execute since <code>index</code> will be initialized to 1, which is already larger than the size of the <code>array – 1</code>, which is 0.) Once we complete the loop, we will be guaranteed that we have the index of the minimum number in the array.</p>

<p>Next, we will walk through the algorithm using our example array in the figure below. Step 1 shows the initial time through the loop. In line 5, <code>min</code> is set to <code>0</code> by default and in line 6, <code>index</code> is set equal to <code>1</code>. Line 7 then computes whether <code>array[1] &lt; array[0]</code>. In this case, it is and we set <code>min = 1</code> (which is reflected in the next step where <code>min</code> has the value <code>1</code>).</p>

<p>Step 2 will end up comparing <code>array[2] &lt; array[1]</code>, since <code>min</code> is now 1 and <code>index</code> has been incremented to 2 via the <code>for</code> loop. In this case, <code>array[2]</code> is less than <code>array[1]</code> so we update <code>min</code> again, this time to 2.</p>
<p>Step 3 follows the same process; however, this time the value in <code>array[3]</code> is 55, which is greater than the current minimum of 3 in <code>array[2]</code>. Therefore, <code>min</code> is not updated. Step 4 finds the minimum value in the array of <code>-3</code> at index 4 and so updates <code>min</code> to 4. However, steps 5, 6, and 7 do not find new minimum values. Thus, when the loop exits after Step 6, <code>min</code> is set to 4 and this value is returned to the calling program in line 11.</p>

<h1 id="linear-search-time-complexity">Linear Search Time Complexity</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;ve examined many different versions of a linear search algorithm. We can find the first occurrence of a number in an array, the last occurrence of that number, or a value with a particular property, such as the minimum value. Each of these are examples of a linear search, since we look at each element in the container sequentially until we find what we are looking for.</p>
<p>So, what would be the time complexity of this process? To understand that, we must consider what the worst-case input would be. For this discussion, we&rsquo;ll just look at the <code>find</code> function, but the results are similar for many other forms of linear search. The pseudocode for <code>find</code> is included below for reference.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-py" data-lang="py"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl"><span class="n">function</span> <span class="n">FIND</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NUMBER</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ARRAY</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">8</span><span class="cl"><span class="n">end</span> <span class="n">function</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>How would we determine what the worst-case input for this function would be? In this case, we want to come up with the input that would require the most steps to find the answer, regardless of the size of the container. Obviously, it would take more steps to find a value in a larger container, but that doesn&rsquo;t really tell us what the worst-case input would be.</p>
<p>Therefore, the time complexity for a linear search algorithm is clearly proportional to the number of items that we need to search through, in this case the size of our array. Whether we use an iterative algorithm or a recursive algorithm, we still need to search the array one item at a time. We&rsquo;ll refer to the size of the array as $N$.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the key: when searching for minimum or maximum values, the search will always take exactly $N$ comparisons since we have to check each value. However, if we are searching for a specific value, the actual number of comparisons required may be fewer than $N$.</p>
<p>To build a worst-case input for the <code>find</code> function, we would search for the situation where the value to find is either the last value in the array, or it is not present at all. For example, consider the array we&rsquo;ve been using to explore each linear search algorithm so far.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-e3574e88b2f1c1d11ccc0f6fff66355c" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Array of Numbers" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.7.array.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-e3574e88b2f1c1d11ccc0f6fff66355c"><img alt="Array of Numbers" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.7.array.png"></a></p>
<p>What if we are trying to find the value 55 in this array? In that case, we&rsquo;ll end up looking at 4 of the 8 elements in the array. This would take $N/2$ steps. Can we think of another input that would be worse?</p>
<p>Consider the case where we try to find 0 instead. Will that be worse? In that case, we&rsquo;ll need to look at all 8 elements in the array before we find it. That requires $N$ steps!</p>
<p>What if we are asked to find 1 in the array? Since 1 is not in the array, we&rsquo;ll have to look at every single element before we know that it can&rsquo;t be found. Once again, that requires $N$ steps.</p>
<p>We could say that in the worst-case, a linear search algorithm requires &ldquo;on the order of $N$&rdquo; time to find an answer. Put another way, if we double the size of the array, we would also need to double the expected number of steps required to find an item in the worst case. We sometimes call this linear time, since the number of steps required grows at the same rate as the size of the input.</p>
<h2 id="can-we-do-better">Can We Do Better?</h2>
<p>Our question now becomes, &ldquo;Is a search that takes on the order of $N$ time really all that bad?&rdquo;. Actually, it depends. Obviously, if $N$ is a small number (less than 1000 or so) it may not be a big deal, if you only do a single search. However, what if we need to do many searches? Is there something we can do to make the process of searching for elements even easier?</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-4296e32a99a3e2a5324b4a6e6c14a547" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Stack of Files" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.7.files.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the real world once again for some insights. For example, think of a pile of loose papers on the floor. If we wanted to find a specific paper, how would we do it?</p>
<p>In most cases, we would simply have to perform a linear search, picking up each paper one at a time and seeing if it is the one we need. This is pretty inefficient, especially if the pile of papers is large.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-1909e1792fc273076e915db8bbc8aa80" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="File Cabinet" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.7.cabinet.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-1909e1792fc273076e915db8bbc8aa80"><img alt="File Cabinet" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.7.cabinet.png"></a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>What if we stored the papers in a filing cabinet and organized them somehow? For example, could we sort the papers by title in alphabetical order? Then, when we want to find a particular paper, we can just skip to the section that contains files with the desired first letter and go from there. In fact, we could even do this for the second and third letter, continuing to jump forward in the filing cabinet until we found the paper we need.</p>
<p>This seems like a much more efficient way to go about searching for things. In fact, we do this naturally without even realizing it. Most computers have a way to sort files alphabetically when viewing the file system, and anyone who has a collection of items has probably spent time organizing and alphabetizing the collection to make it easier to find specific items.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we can come up with a way to organize the elements in our array, we may be able to make the process of finding a particular item much more efficient. In the next section, we&rsquo;ll look at how we can use various sorting algorithms to do just that.</p>

<h1 id="sorting">Sorting</h1>

<p>Sorting is the process we use to organize an ordered container in a way that we understand what the ordering of the values represents. Recall that an ordered container just enforces an ordering between values, but that ordering may appear to be random. By sorting an ordered container, we can enforce a specific ordering on the elements in the container, allowing us to more quickly find specific elements as we&rsquo;ll see later in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="ascending-and-descending-order">Ascending and Descending Order</h2>
<p>In most cases, we sort values in either ascending or descending order. Ascending order means that the smallest value will be first, and then each value will get progressively larger until the largest value, which is at the end of the container. Descending order is the opposite&mdash;the largest value will be first, and then values will get progressively smaller until the smallest value is last.</p>
<p>We can also define this mathematically. Assume that we have a container called <code>array</code> and two indexes in that container, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. If the container is sorted in ascending order, we would say that if <code>a</code> is less than <code>b</code> (that is, the element at index <code>a</code> comes before the element at index <code>b</code>), then the element at index <code>a</code> is less than or equal to the element at index <code>b</code>. More succinctly:</p>
$$
a < b \implies \text{array}[a] \leq \text{array}[b]
$$
<p>Likewise, if the container is sorted in descending order, we would know that if <code>a</code> is less than <code>b</code>, then the element at index <code>a</code> would be greater than or equal to the element at index <code>b</code>. Or:</p>
$$
a < b \implies \text{array}[a] \geq \text{array}[b]
$$
<p>These facts will be important later when we discuss the precondition, postconditions, and loop invariants of algorithms in this section.</p>
<h2 id="sorting-algorithms">Sorting Algorithms</h2>
<p>To sort a collection of data, we can use one of many sorting algorithms to perform that action. While there are many different algorithms out there for sorting, there are a few commonly used algorithms for this process, each one with its own pros, cons, and time complexity. These algorithms are studied extensively by programmers, and nearly every programmer learns how to write and use these algorithms as part of their learning process. In this module, we&rsquo;ll introduce you to the 4 most commonly used sorting algorithms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selection Sort,</li>
<li>Bubble Sort,</li>
<li>Merge Sort, and</li>
<li>Quicksort.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="selection-sort">Selection Sort</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76NNveliJQM">YouTube Video</a>

<p>The first sorting algorithm we&rsquo;ll learn about is <em>selection sort</em>. The basic idea behind selection sort is to search for the minimum value in the whole container, and place it in the first index. Then, repeat the process for the second smallest value and the second index, and so on until the container is sorted.</p>
<p>Wikipedia includes a great animation that shows this process:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-dfd252e7f88e2a16164cfd589fa34e46" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Selection Sort GIF" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.9.selection.gif" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>In this animation, the element highlighted in blue is the element currently being considered. The red element shows the value that is the minimum value considered, and the yellow elements are the sorted portion of the list.</p>
<h2 id="selection-sort-example">Selection Sort Example</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a few steps in this process to see how it works. First, the algorithm will search through the array to find the minimum value. It will start by looking at index 0 as shown in the figure below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-9689fa7ef3205839264cc955a8de3d47" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Selection Sort Step 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.9.select1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-9689fa7ef3205839264cc955a8de3d47"><img alt="Selection Sort Step 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.9.select1.png"></a></p>
<p>Once it reaches the end of the array, it will find that the smallest value 0 is at index 8.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-d1b4b5a3b7b39a86ac7753f44023d05c" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Selection Sort Step 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.9.select2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-d1b4b5a3b7b39a86ac7753f44023d05c"><img alt="Selection Sort Step 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.9.select2.png"></a></p>
<p>Then, it will <em>swap</em> the minimum item with the item at index 0 of the array, placing the smallest item first. That item will now be part of the sorted array, so we&rsquo;ll shade it in since we don&rsquo;t want to move it again.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-b9f0abcfb4d588554077410db84eb790" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Selection Sort Step 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.9.select3.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Next, it will reset index to 1, and start searching for the next smallest element in the array. Notice that this time it will not look at the element at index 0, which is part of the sorted array. Each time the algorithm resets, it will start looking at the element directly after the sorted portion of the array.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-535eada097084f3740c0151f56ef8379" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Selection Sort Step 4" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.9.select4.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Once again, it will search through the array to find the smallest value, which will be the value 1 at index 6.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-e23720232c03054a612943a12a3067b6" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Selection Sort Step 5" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.9.select5.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Then, it will swap the element at index 1 with the minimum element, this time at index 6. Just like before, we&rsquo;ll shade in the first element since it is now part of the sorted list, and reset the index to begin at index 2</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-8437077fd6e5d87bf1185e6eeb56e31f" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Selection Sort Step 6" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.9.select6.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>This process will repeat until the entire array is sorted in ascending order.</p>

<p>In this code, we begin by looping through every element in the array except the last one, as seen on line 2. We don&rsquo;t include this one because if the rest of the array is sorted properly, then the last element must be the maximum value.</p>
<p>Lines 3 through 9 are basically the same as what we saw in our <code>findMin</code> function earlier. It will find the index of the minimum value starting at <code>INDEX</code> through the end of the array. Notice that we are starting at <code>INDEX</code> instead of the beginning. As the outer loop moves through the array, the inner loop will consider fewer and fewer elements. This is because the front of the array contains our sorted elements, and we don&rsquo;t want to change them once they are in place.</p>
<p>Lines 11 through 13 will then swap the elements at <code>INDEX</code> and <code>MININDEX</code>, putting the smallest element left in the array at the position pointed to by index.</p>
<p>We can describe the invariant of our outer loop as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The array from index 0 through <code>index</code> is sorted in ascending order.</li>
<li>The elements in the array have not changed, only their positions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second part of the loop invariant is very important. Without that distinction, we could simply place new values into the array before <code>index</code> and satisfy the first part of the invariant. It is always important to specify that the array itself still contains the same elements as before.</p>

<h1 id="selection-sort-time-complexity">Selection Sort Time Complexity</h1>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the time complexity of the selection sort algorithm, just so we can get a feel for how much time this operation takes.</p>
<p>First, we must determine if there is a worst-case input for selection sort. Can we think of any particular input which would require more steps to complete?</p>
<p>In this case, each iteration of selection sort will look at the same number of elements, no matter what they are. So there isn&rsquo;t a particular input that would be considered worst-case. We can proceed with just the general case.</p>
<p>In each iteration of the algorithm we need to search for the minimum value of the remaining elements in the container. If the container has $N$ elements, we would follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first time we need to find the minimum among $N$ elements. This will take $N$ comparisons assuming the element are compared one by one with the minimum.</li>
<li>The second time we need to find the minimum among $N - 1$ elements. This will take $N - 1$ comparisons.</li>
<li>The third time we need to find the minimum among $N - 2$ elements. This will take $N - 2$ comparisons.</li>
<li>&hellip; and so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process continues until we have sorted all of the elements in the array. The number of steps will be:</p>
$$
N + (N – 1) + (N – 2) + … + 2 + 1
$$
<p>While it takes a bit of math to figure out exactly what that means, we can use some intuition to determine an approximate value. For example we could pair up the values like this:</p>
$$
N + [(N – 1) + 1] + [(N – 2) + 2] + ...
$$
<p>When we do that, we&rsquo;ll see that we can create around $N / 2$ pairs, each one with the value of $N$. So a rough approximation of this value is $N * (N / 2)$, which is $N^2 / 2$. When analyzing time complexity, we would say that this is &ldquo;on the order of $N^2$&rdquo; time. Put another way, if the size of $N$ doubles, we would expect the number of steps to go up by a factor of $4$, since $(2 * N)^2 = 4N$.</p>
<p>Later on, we&rsquo;ll come back to this and compare the time complexity of each sorting algorithm and searching algorithm to see how they stack up against each other.</p>

<h1 id="bubble-sort">Bubble Sort</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyyfpADUpaU">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s look at another sorting algorithm, bubble sort. The basic idea behind bubble sort is to continuously iterate through the array and swap adjacent elements that are out of order. As a side effect of this process, the largest element in the array will be &ldquo;bubbled&rdquo; to the end of the array after the first iteration. Subsequent iterations will do the same for each of the next largest elements, until eventually the entire list is sorted.</p>
<p>Wikipedia includes a great animation that shows this process:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-8fb7dfdd0d0c4e996da822f1df51dd59" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Bubble Sort GIF" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble.gif" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-8fb7dfdd0d0c4e996da822f1df51dd59"><img alt="Bubble Sort GIF" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble.gif"></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In this animation, the two red boxes slowly move through the array, comparing adjacent elements. If the elements are not in the correct order (that is, the first element is larger than the second element), then it will swap them. Once it reaches the end, the largest element, 8, will be placed at the end and locked in place.</p>
<h2 id="bubble-sort-example">Bubble Sort Example</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through a few steps of this process and see how it works. We&rsquo;ll use the array we used previously for selection sort, just to keep things simple. At first, the array will look like the diagram below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-d44fe263fa8913574af6b8b8481969c2" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-d44fe263fa8913574af6b8b8481969c2"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble1.png"></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll begin with the <code>index</code> variable pointing at index 0. Our algorithm should compare the values at index 0 and index 1 and see if they need to be swapped. We&rsquo;ll put a bold border around the elements we are currently comparing in the figure below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-8d6036a53cc01942dc7deb34e675c7fb" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-8d6036a53cc01942dc7deb34e675c7fb"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble2.png"></a></p>
<p>Since the element at index 0 is 8, and the element at index 1 is 5, we know that they must be swapped since 8 is greater than 5. We need to swap those two elements in the array, as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-cee99fa4a9d4fe7105608635ef1c32dc" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble3.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-cee99fa4a9d4fe7105608635ef1c32dc"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble3.png"></a></p>
<p>Once those two elements have been swapped, the index variable will be incremented by 1, and we&rsquo;ll look at the elements at indexes 1 and 2 next.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-d82b439fc5bd61b1f1aaa650223b56c5" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 4" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble4.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-d82b439fc5bd61b1f1aaa650223b56c5"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 4" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble4.png"></a></p>
<p>Since 8 is greater than 2, we&rsquo;ll swap these two elements before incrementing index to 2 and comparing the next two elements.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-20cada5e7a520d9c7370bd421aa748e6" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 5" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble5.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-20cada5e7a520d9c7370bd421aa748e6"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 5" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble5.png"></a></p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;ll find that 8 is greater than 6, so we&rsquo;ll swap these two elements and move on to index 3.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-b131627e0d200f06be019a695208907e" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 6" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble6.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-b131627e0d200f06be019a695208907e"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 6" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble6.png"></a></p>
<p>Now we are looking at the element at index 3, which is 8, and the element at index 4, which is 9. In this case, 8 is less than 9, so we don&rsquo;t need to swap anything. We&rsquo;ll just increment index by 1 and look at the elements at indexes 4 and 5.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-9c22a02ef7ebe9d39aa0e622af3aa527" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 7" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble7.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-9c22a02ef7ebe9d39aa0e622af3aa527"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 7" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble7.png"></a></p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve done before, we&rsquo;ll find that 9 is greater than 3, so we&rsquo;ll need to swap those two items. In fact, as we continue to move through the array, we&rsquo;ll find that 9 is the largest item in the entire array, so we&rsquo;ll end up swapping it with every element down to the end of the array. At that point, it will be in its final position, so we&rsquo;ll lock it and restart the process again.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-93a82f9fdeed38cb73ad1b1dbcdb33b4" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 8" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble8.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-93a82f9fdeed38cb73ad1b1dbcdb33b4"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 8" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble8.png"></a></p>
<p>After making a second pass through the array, swapping elements that must be swapped as we find them, we&rsquo;ll eventually get to the end and find that 8 should be placed at index 8 since it is the next largest value in the array.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-9da60f2851682bdb6fa980b5cf4383fc" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Bubble Sort Example 9" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.12.bubble9.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>We can then continue this process until we have locked each element in place at the end of the array.</p>

<p>In this code, we begin by looping through every element in the array, as seen on line 3. Each time we run this outer loop, we&rsquo;ll lock one additional element in place at the end of the array. Therefore, we need to run it once for each element in the array.</p>
<p>On line 5, we&rsquo;ll start at the beginning of the array and loop to the place where the sorted portion of the array begins. We know that after each iteration of the outer loop, the value <code>index</code> will represent the number of locked elements at the end of the array. We can subtract that value from the end of the array to find where we want to stop.</p>
<p>Line 6 is a comparison between two adjacent elements in the array starting at the index <code>index2</code>. If they are out of order, we use lines 8 through 10 to swap them. That&rsquo;s really all it takes to do a bubble sort!</p>
<p>Looking at this code, we can describe the invariant of our outer loop as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last <code>index</code> elements in the array are in sorted order, and</li>
<li>The elements in the array have not changed, only their positions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how this differs from selection sort, since it places the sorted elements at the beginning of the array instead of the end. However, the result is the same, and by the end of the program we can show that each algorithm has fully sorted the array.</p>

<h1 id="bubble-sort-time-complexity">Bubble Sort Time Complexity</h1>

<p>Once again, let&rsquo;s look at the time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm and see how it compares to selection sort.</p>
<p>Bubble sort is a bit trickier to analyze than selection sort, because there are really two parts to the algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of comparisons, and</li>
<li>The number of swaps.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at each one individually. First, is there a way to reduce the number of comparisons made by this algorithm just by changing the input? As it turns out, there isn&rsquo;t anything we can do to change that based on how it is written. The number of comparisons only depends on the size of the array. In fact, the analysis is exactly the same as selection sort, since each iteration of the outer loop does one fewer comparison. Therefore, we can say that bubble sort has time complexity on the order of $N^2$ time when it comes to comparisons.</p>
<p>What about swaps? This is where it gets a bit tricky. What would be the worst-case input for the bubble sort algorithm, which would result in the largest number of swaps made?</p>
<p>Consider a case where the input is sorted in descending order. The largest element will be first, and the smallest element will be last. If we want the result to be sorted in ascending order, we would end up making $N - 1$ swaps to get the first element to the end of the array, then $N - 2$ swaps for the second element, and so on. So, once again we end up with the same series as before:</p>
$$
(N – 1) + (N – 2) + ... + 2 + 1.
$$
<p>In the worst-case, we&rsquo;ll also end up doing on the order of $N^2$ swaps, so bubble sort has a time complexity on the order of $N^2$ time when it comes to swaps as well.</p>
<h2 id="comparing-selection-sort-and-bubble-sort">Comparing Selection Sort and Bubble Sort</h2>
<p>It seems that both bubble sort and selection sort are in the same order of time complexity, meaning that each one will take roughly the same amount of time to sort the same array. Does that tell us anything about the process of sorting an array?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one way to think about it: what if we decided to compare each element in an array to every other element? How many comparisons would that take? We can use our intuition to know that each element in an array of $N$ elements would require $N – 1$ comparisons, so the total number of comparisons would be $N * (N – 1)$, which is very close to $N^2$.</p>
<p>Of course, once we&rsquo;ve compared each element to every other element, we&rsquo;d know exactly where to place them in a sorted array. One possible conclusion we could make is that there isn&rsquo;t any way to sort an array that runs much faster than an algorithm that runs in the order of $N^2$ time.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that conclusion is incorrect! There are several other sorting algorithms we can use that allow us to sort an array much more quickly than $N^2$ time. Let&rsquo;s take a look at those algorithms and see how they work!</p>

<h1 id="merge-sort">Merge Sort</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCBt3y_R_Co">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Another commonly used sorting algorithm is <em>merge sort</em>. Merge sort uses a recursive, divide and conquer approach to sorting, which makes it very powerful. It was actually developed to handle sorting data sets that were so large that they couldn&rsquo;t fit on a single memory device, way back in the early days of computing.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the merge sort algorithm is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the container only contains one or two elements, we can quickly sort that container by swapping the elements if needed.</li>
<li>Otherwise, we should divide the container in half and recursively use merge sort on each half.</li>
<li>Once each half is sorted, we can then merge them back together into a single container.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once again, Wikipedia has a great animation showing this process:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-58af9c5f5fc229ff5cacc303de4326d9" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort GIF" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge.gif" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<h2 id="merge-sort-example">Merge Sort Example</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through a simple example and see how it works. First, we&rsquo;ll start with the same initial array as before, shown in the figure below. To help us keep track, we&rsquo;ll refer to this function call using the array indexes it covers. It will be <code>mergeSort(0, 9)</code>.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-81c882578462aa20051ce74ca9c37847" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-81c882578462aa20051ce74ca9c37847"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge1.png"></a></p>
<p>Since this array contains more than 2 elements, we won&rsquo;t be able to sort it quickly. Instead, we&rsquo;ll divide it in half, and sort each half using merge sort again. Let&rsquo;s continue the process with the first half of the array. We&rsquo;ll use a thick outline to show the current portion of the array we are sorting, but we&rsquo;ll retain the original array indexes to help keep track of everything.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-a7c91bc23ad66e5f11efda290ac300b5" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-a7c91bc23ad66e5f11efda290ac300b5"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge2.png"></a></p>
<p>Now we are in the first recursive call, <code>mergeSort(0, 4)</code>,which is looking at the first half of the original array. Once again, we have more than 2 elements, so we&rsquo;ll split it in half and recursively call <code>mergeSort(0, 1)</code> first.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-d3ca3e0fa354b6bd2fc0b1fb31ee4fcb" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge3.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-d3ca3e0fa354b6bd2fc0b1fb31ee4fcb"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge3.png"></a></p>
<p>At this point, we now have an array with just 2 elements. We can use one of our base cases to sort that array by swapping the two elements, if needed. In this case, we should swap them, so we&rsquo;ll get the result shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-3d688b8bf6dbbc9b77807f4bd5af64b0" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 4" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge4.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-3d688b8bf6dbbc9b77807f4bd5af64b0"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 4" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge4.png"></a></p>
<p>Now that the first half of the smaller array has been sorted, our recursive call <code>mergeSort(0, 1)</code> will return and we&rsquo;ll look at the second half of the smaller array in the second recursive call, <code>mergeSort(2, 4)</code>, as highlighted below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-f6834a95f0cbfa79f60dd4fa47c6d590" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 5" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge5.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-f6834a95f0cbfa79f60dd4fa47c6d590"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 5" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge5.png"></a></p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen before, this array has more than 2 elements, so we&rsquo;ll need to divide it in half and recursively call the function again. First, we&rsquo;ll call <code>mergeSort(2, 2)</code>.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-765416b8d5810bcf2972d2f78469b16b" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 6" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge6.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-765416b8d5810bcf2972d2f78469b16b"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 6" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge6.png"></a></p>
<p>In this case, the current array we are considering contains a single element, so it is already sorted. Therefore, the recursive call to <code>mergeSort(2, 2)</code> will return quickly, and we&rsquo;ll consider the second part of the smaller array in <code>mergeSort(3, 4)</code>, highlighted below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-fcc70d33bff24d016f630a00248b779e" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 7" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge7.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-fcc70d33bff24d016f630a00248b779e"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 7" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge7.png"></a></p>
<p>Here, we have 2 elements, and this time they are already sorted. So, we don&rsquo;t need to do anything, and our recursive call to <code>mergeSort(3, 4)</code> will return. At this point, we will be back in our call to <code>mergeSort(2, 4)</code>, and both halves of that array have been sorted. We&rsquo;re back to looking at the highlighted elements below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-5a622fc20cbe3d01d20456644323cfa5" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 8" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge8.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-5a622fc20cbe3d01d20456644323cfa5"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 8" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge8.png"></a></p>
<p>Now we have to merge these two arrays together. Thankfully, since they are sorted, we can follow this simple process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a temporary array that has the same size as both halves combined.</li>
<li>Look at the first element of each half of the original array. Choose the smaller of the two.</li>
<li>Place that element first in the temporary array.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until one half is empty.</li>
<li>Place the remaining elements of the half that is not empty at the end of the temporary array.</li>
<li>Replace the original array with the temporary array.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what that process would look like. First, we&rsquo;ll create a new temporary array to store the result.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-7855c7c1373922430bd2a0430008002b" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 9" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge9.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-7855c7c1373922430bd2a0430008002b"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 9" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge9.png"></a></p>
<p>Next, we will look at the first element in each of the two sorted halves of the original array. In this case, we&rsquo;ll compare 2 and 6, which are highlighted below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-8d3bf853b3bcd07877f5fa4bf4e70c99" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 10" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge10.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-8d3bf853b3bcd07877f5fa4bf4e70c99"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 10" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge10.png"></a></p>
<p>Now we should pick the smaller of those two values, which will be 2. That value will be placed in the new temporary array at the very beginning.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-39c6c3be04da0ceef2c093cc5551a91d" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 11" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge11.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-39c6c3be04da0ceef2c093cc5551a91d"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 11" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge11.png"></a></p>
<p>Next, we should look at the remaining halves of the array. Since the first half is empty, we can just place the remaining elements from the second half into the temporary array.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-4f039d49a0e6f1ea14a4672ce4695f13" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 12" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge12.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-4f039d49a0e6f1ea14a4672ce4695f13"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 12" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge12.png"></a></p>
<p>Finally, we should replace the portion of the original array that we are looking at in this recursive call with the temporary array. In most cases, we&rsquo;ll just copy these elements into the correct places in the original array. In the diagram, we&rsquo;ll just replace them.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-9be8598cfc3ce9e3af540a64aa546fed" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 13" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge13.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-9be8598cfc3ce9e3af540a64aa546fed"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 13" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge13.png"></a></p>
<p>There we go! We&rsquo;ve now completed the recursive call <code>mergeSort(2, 4)</code>. We can return from that recursive call and go back to <code>mergeSort(0, 4)</code>.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-aa438181991241dbad037f2ecb03268e" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 14" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge14.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-aa438181991241dbad037f2ecb03268e"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 14" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge14.png"></a></p>
<p>Since both halves of the array in <code>mergeSort(0, 4)</code> are sorted, we must do the merge process again.  We&rsquo;ll start with a new temporary array and compare the first element in each half.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-5c57c6a4843b7c43da438c68f135342c" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 15" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge15.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-5c57c6a4843b7c43da438c68f135342c"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 15" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge15.png"></a></p>
<p>At this point, we&rsquo;ll see that 2 is the smaller of those elements, so we&rsquo;ll place it in the first slot in the temporary array and consider the next element in the second half.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-096368482c4e322cde1908d7ab4bff7f" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 16" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge16.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-096368482c4e322cde1908d7ab4bff7f"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 16" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge16.png"></a></p>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll compare the values 5 and 6, and see that 5 is smaller. It should be placed in the next available element in our temporary array and we should continue onward.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-69df83b10a4207f6ddd5d146fa6014fe" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 17" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge17.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-69df83b10a4207f6ddd5d146fa6014fe"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 17" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge17.png"></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll repeat this process again, placing the 6 in the temporary array, then the 8, then finally the 9.  After completing the merge process, we&rsquo;ll have the following temporary array.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-21f010e98ca9de409b6901470d6137ac" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 18" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge18.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-21f010e98ca9de409b6901470d6137ac"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 18" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge18.png"></a></p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll replace the original elements with the now merged elements in the temporary array.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-9b2f5644d9e5a1d394b8bfbaf3daf16a" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 19" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge19.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-9b2f5644d9e5a1d394b8bfbaf3daf16a"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 19" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge19.png"></a></p>
<p>There we go! We&rsquo;ve now completed the process in the <code>mergeSort(0, 4)</code> recursive call. Once that returns, we&rsquo;ll be back in our original call to <code>mergeSort(0, 9)</code>. In that function, we&rsquo;ll recursively call the process again on the second half of the array using <code>mergeSort(5, 9)</code>.</p>
<p>Hopefully by now we understand that it will work just like we intended, so by the time that recursive call returns, we&rsquo;ll now have the second half of the array sorted as well.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-385d0709b5505864072bb6c56eefd5d1" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 20" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge20.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-385d0709b5505864072bb6c56eefd5d1"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 20" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge20.png"></a></p>
<p>The last step in the original <code>mergeSort(0, 9)</code> function call is to merge these two halves together. So, once again, we&rsquo;ll follow that same process as before, creating a new temporary array and moving through the elements in each half, placing the smaller of the two in the new array. Once we are done, we&rsquo;ll end up with a temporary array that has been populated as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-efdb56a2b186329e969ba0c8df6bfa24" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 21" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge21.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-efdb56a2b186329e969ba0c8df6bfa24"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 21" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge21.png"></a></p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll replace the elements in the original array with the ones in the temporary array, resulting in a completely sorted result.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-7aa4eaf7b3c7d93d72ae8da7da3ef0fa" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Example 22" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.15.merge22.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>This function is a recursive function which has two base cases. The first base case is shown in lines 3 through 5, where the size of the array is exactly 1. In that case, the array is already sorted, so we just return on line 4 without doing anything.</p>
<p>The other base case is shown in lines 7 through 15. In this case, the element contains just two elements. We can use the if statement on line 9 to check  if those two elements are in the correct order. If not, we can use lines 11 through 13 to swap them, before returning on line 15.</p>
<p>If neither of the base cases occurs, then we reach the recursive case starting on line 18. First, we&rsquo;ll need to determine the midpoint of the array, which is just the average of the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> variables. We&rsquo;ll need to remember to make sure that value is an integer by truncating it if needed.</p>
<p>Then, on lines 20 and 22 we make two recursive calls, each one focusing on a different half of the array. Once each of those calls returns, we can assume that each half of the array is now sorted.</p>
<p>Finally, in line 24 we call a helper function known as <code>merge</code> to merge the two halves together. The pseudocode for that process is below.</p>

<p>The <code>merge</code> function begins by creating some variables. The <code>tempArray</code> will hold the newly merged array. <code>Index1</code> refers to the element in the first half that is being considered, while <code>index2</code> refers to the element in the second half. Finally, <code>newIndex</code> keeps track of our position in the new array.</p>
<p>The first loop starting on line 6 will continue operating until one half or the other has been completely added to the temporary array. It starts by comparing the first element in each half of the array. Then, depending on which one is smaller, it will place the smaller of the two in the new array and increment the indexes.</p>
<p>Once the first loop has completed, there are two more loops starting on lines 16 and 21. However, only one of those loops will actually execute, since only one half of the array will have any elements left in it to be considered. These loops will simply copy the remaining elements to the end of the temporary array.</p>
<p>Finally, the last loop starting on line 26 will copy the elements from the temporary array back into the source array. At this point, they will be properly merged in sorted order.</p>

<h1 id="merge-sort-time-complexity">Merge Sort Time Complexity</h1>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve reviewed the pseudocode for the merge sort algorithm, let&rsquo;s see if we can analyze the time it takes to complete. Analyzing a recursive algorithm requires quite a bit of math and understanding to do it properly, but we can get a pretty close answer using a bit of intuition about what it does.</p>
<p>For starters, let&rsquo;s consider a diagram that shows all of the different recursive calls made by merge sort, as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-3496a0107b3c1e0fe6193c2dabca9c64" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Time Complexity Diagram 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.17.mergetree.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-3496a0107b3c1e0fe6193c2dabca9c64"><img alt="Merge Sort Time Complexity Diagram 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.17.mergetree.png"></a></p>
<p>The first thing we should do is consider the worst-case input for merge sort. What would that look like? Put another way, would the values or the ordering of those values change anything about how merge sort operates?</p>
<p>The only real impact that the input would have is on the number of swaps made by merge sort. If we had an input that caused each of the base cases with exactly two elements to swap them, that would be a few more steps than any other input. Consider the highlighted entries below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-99f6ec76d5a44e0a47c8ff9ac1cd0939" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Time Complexity Diagram 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.17.mergetree2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-99f6ec76d5a44e0a47c8ff9ac1cd0939"><img alt="Merge Sort Time Complexity Diagram 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.17.mergetree2.png"></a></p>
<p>If each of those pairs were reversed, we&rsquo;d end up doing that many swaps. So, how many swaps would that be? As it turns out, a good estimate would be $N / 2$ times. If we have an array with exactly 16 elements, there are at most 8 swaps we could make. With 10 elements, we can make at most 4. So, the number of swaps is on the order of N time complexity.</p>
<p>What about the merge operation? How many steps does that take? This is a bit trickier to answer, but let&rsquo;s look at each row of the diagram above. Across all of the calls to merge sort on each row, we&rsquo;ll end up merging all $N$ elements in the original array at least once. Therefore, we know that it would take around $N$ steps for each row in the diagram. We&rsquo;ll just need to figure out how many rows there are.</p>
<p>A better way to phrase that question might be &ldquo;how many times can we recursively divide an array of $N$ elements in half?&rdquo; As it turns out, the answer to that question lies in the use of the logarithm.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Logarithm</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>The logarithm is the inverse of exponentiation. For example, we could have the exponentiation formula:</p>
$$
\text{base}^{\text{exponent}} = \text{power}
$$
<p>The inverse of that would be the logarithm
</p>
$$
\text{log}_{\text{base}}(\text{power}) = \text{exponent}
$$
<p>So, if we know a value and base, we can determine the exponent required to raise that base to the given value.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this case, we would need to use the logarithm with base $2$, since we are dividing the array in half each time. So, we would say that the number of rows in that diagram, or the number of levels in our tree would be on the order of $\text{log}_2(N)$. In computer science, we typically write $\text{log}_2$ as $\text{lg}$, so we&rsquo;ll say it is on the order of $\text{lg}(N)$.</p>
<p>To get an idea of how that works, consider the case where the array contains exactly $16$ elements. In that case, the value $\text{lg}(16)$ is $4$, since $2^4 = 16$. If we use the diagram above as a model, we can draw a similar diagram for an array containing $16$ elements and find that it indeed has $4$ levels.</p>
<p>If we double the size of the array, we&rsquo;ll now have $32$ elements. However, even by doubling the size of the array, the value of $\text{lg}(32)$ is just $5$, so it has only increased by $1$. In fact, each time we double the size of the array, the value of $\text{lg}(N)$ will only go up by $1$.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we can say that the merge operation runs on the order of $N * \text{lg}(N)$ time. That is because there are ${\text{lg}(N)}$ levels in the tree, and each level of the tree performs $N$ operations to merge various parts of the array together. The diagram below gives a good graphical representation of how we can come to that conclusion.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-d0c67814ed05d40758b75665846001bc" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort Time Complexity Diagram 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.17.mergetree3.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Putting it all together, we have $N/2$ swaps, and $N * \text{lg}(N)$ steps for the merge. Since the value $N * \text{lg}(N)$ is larger than $N$, we would say that total running time of merge sort is on the order of $N * \text{lg}(N)$.</p>
<p>Later on in this chapter we&rsquo;ll discuss how that compares to the running time of selection sort and bubble sort and how that impacts our programs.</p>

<h1 id="quicksort">Quicksort</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_jc6gP0RXY">YouTube Video</a>

<p>The last sorting algorithm we will review in this module is quicksort. Quicksort is another example of a recursive, divide and conquer sorting algorithm, and at first glance it may look very similar to merge sort. However, quicksort uses a different process for dividing the array, and that can produce some very interesting results.</p>
<p>The basic idea of quicksort is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a pivot value, called <code>pivotValue</code>. This value could be any random value in the array. In our implementation, we&rsquo;ll simply use the last value.</li>
<li>Partition the values in the container into two parts:
<ol>
<li>the left part contains all the elements less than or equal to the value of <code>pivotValue</code></li>
<li>the right part contains all the elements greater than the value of <code>pivotValue</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Place <code>pivotValue</code> in between those two parts. We&rsquo;ll call the index of <code>pivotValue</code> the <code>pivotIndex</code>.</li>
<li>Recursively sort the two parts by calling the quicksort procedure again:
<ol>
<li>the first call sorts the values in the container from start to <code>pivotIndex – 1</code></li>
<li>the second call sort the values in the container from <code>pivotIndex + 1</code> to the end</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Once the recursive calls are complete, the entire container should be sorted.</li>
</ol>
<p>As with all of the other examples we&rsquo;ve looked at in this module, Wikipedia provides yet another excellent animation showing this process.</p>

<h2 id="quicksort-example">Quicksort Example</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example of the quicksort algorithm in action to see how it works. Unlike the other sorting algorithms we&rsquo;ve seen, this one may appear to be just randomly swapping elements around at first glance. However, as we move through the example, we should start to see how it achieves a sorted result, usually very quickly!</p>
<p>We can start with our same initial array, shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-758d6de6c9a169a52ade32f054e09706" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-758d6de6c9a169a52ade32f054e09706"><img alt="Quicksort Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick1.png"></a></p>
<p>The first step is to choose a pivot value. As we discussed above, we can choose any random value in the array. However, to make it simple, we&rsquo;ll just use the last value. We will create two variables, <code>pivotValue</code> and <code>pivotIndex</code>, to help us keep track of things. We&rsquo;ll set <code>pivotValue</code> to the last value in the array, and <code>pivotIndex</code> will initially be set to 0. We&rsquo;ll see why in a few steps.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-2e77695f5ab32a2cee74a6f674e140e3" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Example 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-2e77695f5ab32a2cee74a6f674e140e3"><img alt="Quicksort Example 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick2.png"></a></p>
<p>Now, the algorithm will iterate across each element in the array, comparing it with the value in <code>pivotValue</code>. If that value is less than or equal to the <code>pivotValue</code>, we should swap the element at <code>pivotIndex</code> with the value we are looking at in the array. Let&rsquo;s see how this would work.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-2ddd2e494d2c51d7314e27695849b917" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Example 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick3.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-2ddd2e494d2c51d7314e27695849b917"><img alt="Quicksort Example 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick3.png"></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;d start by looking at the value at index 0 of the array, which is 8. Since that value is greater than the <code>pivotValue</code>, we do nothing and just look at the next item.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-ceeefe8d412317f97746df78f0e9c0a2" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Example 4" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick4.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-ceeefe8d412317f97746df78f0e9c0a2"><img alt="Quicksort Example 4" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick4.png"></a></p>
<p>Here, we are considering the value 5, which is at index 1 in the array. In this case, that value is less than or equal to the <code>pivotValue</code>. So, we want to swap the current element with the element at our <code>pivotIndex</code>, which is currently 0. Once we do that, we&rsquo;ll also increment our <code>pivotIndex</code> by 1. The diagram below shows these changes before they happen.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-9d981267328461f416b17f5cc7c45b79" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Example 5" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick5.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-9d981267328461f416b17f5cc7c45b79"><img alt="Quicksort Example 5" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick5.png"></a></p>
<p>Once we make those changes, our array should look like the following diagram, and we&rsquo;ll be ready to examine the value at index 2.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-b101184f232133486a013bcc60cf2fd1" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Example 6" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick6.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-b101184f232133486a013bcc60cf2fd1"><img alt="Quicksort Example 6" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick6.png"></a></p>
<p>Once again, the value 2 at index 2 of the array is less than or equal to the pivot value. So, we&rsquo;ll swap them, increment <code>pivotValue</code>, and move to the next element.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-b0634a20de60aa32380ec9efa971279b" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Example 7" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick7.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-b0634a20de60aa32380ec9efa971279b"><img alt="Quicksort Example 7" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick7.png"></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll continue this process, comparing the next element in the array with the <code>pivotValue</code>, and then swapping that element and the element at the <code>pivotIndex</code> if needed, incrementing the <code>pivotIndex</code> after each swap. The diagrams below show the next few steps. First, since 6 is less than or equal to our <code>pivotValue</code>, we&rsquo;ll swap it with the pivot index and increment.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-ed4a35bc6b2e9db8641a264f1e459518" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Example 8" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick8.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-ed4a35bc6b2e9db8641a264f1e459518"><img alt="Quicksort Example 8" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick8.png"></a></p>
<p>However, since 9 is greater than the pivot index, we&rsquo;ll just leave it as is for now and move to the next element.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-0f8171adafa79cdaa55dc739a8a4536e" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Example 9" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick9.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-0f8171adafa79cdaa55dc739a8a4536e"><img alt="Quicksort Example 9" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick9.png"></a></p>
<p>3 is less than or equal to the pivot value, so we&rsquo;ll swap the element at index 3 with the 3 at index 5.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-688b2751099b082899b92e0de7683c3c" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Example 10" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick10.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-688b2751099b082899b92e0de7683c3c"><img alt="Quicksort Example 10" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick10.png"></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see that the elements at indexes 6, 7 and 8 are all less than or equal to the pivot value. So, we&rsquo;ll end up making some swaps until we reach the end of the list.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-b391320c6cece1cdbfa3511386912bfa" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Example 11" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick11.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Finally, we have reached the end of the array, which contains our <code>pivotValue</code> in the last element. Thankfully, we can just continue our process one more step. Since the <code>pivotValue</code> is less than or equal to itself, we swap it with the element at the <code>pivotIndex</code>, and increment that index one last time.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-e726ea060330236d797e9f0249f8d5aa" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Example 14" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick14.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>At this point, we have partitioned the initial array into two sections. The first section contains all of the values which are less than or equal to the pivot value, and the second section contains all values greater than the pivot value.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-bb264e04465f443358abbc615dc3dbc9" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Example 15" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick15.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-bb264e04465f443358abbc615dc3dbc9"><img alt="Quicksort Example 15" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.18.quick15.png"></a></p>
<p>This demonstrates the powerful way that quicksort can quickly partition an array based on a pivot value! With just a single pass through the array, we have created our two halves and done at least some preliminary sorting. The last step is to make two recursive calls to quicksort, one that sorts the items from the beginning of the array through the element right before the <code>pivotValue</code>. The other will sort the elements starting after the <code>pivotValue</code> through the end of the array.</p>
<p>Once each of those recursive calls is complete, the entire array will be sorted!</p>

<h1 id="quicksort-pseudocode">Quicksort Pseudocode</h1>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve seen an example of how quicksort works, let&rsquo;s walk through the pseudocode of a quicksort function. The function itself is very simple, as shown below.</p>

<p>This implementation of quicksort uses a simple base case on lines 3 through 5 to check if the array is either empty, or contains one element. It does so by checking if the <code>START</code> index is greater than or equal to the <code>END</code> index. If so, it can assume the array is sorted and just return it without any additional changes.</p>
<p>The recursive case is shown on lines 6 - 8. It simply uses a helper function called <code>partition</code> on line 6 to partition the array based on a pivot value. That function returns the location of the pivot value, which is stored in <code>pivotIndex</code>. Then, on lines 7 and 8, the quicksort function is called recursively on the two partitions of the array, before and after the <code>pivotIndex</code>. That&rsquo;s really all there is to it!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one way we could implement the <code>partition</code> function, shown below in pseudocode.</p>

<p>This function begins on lines 2 and 3 by setting initial values for the <code>pivotValue</code> by choosing the last element in the array, and then setting the <code>pivotIndex</code> to 0. Then, the loop on lines 4 through 11 will look at each element in the array, determine if it is less than or equal to <code>pivotValue</code>, and swap that element with the element at <code>pivotIndex</code> if so, incrementing <code>pivotIndex</code> after each swap.</p>
<p>At the end, the value that was originally at the end of the array will be at location <code>pivotIndex – 1</code>, so we will return that value back to the <code>quicksort</code> function so it can split the array into two parts based on that value.</p>

<h1 id="quicksort-time-complexity">Quicksort Time Complexity</h1>

<p>To wrap up our analysis of the quicksort algorithm, let&rsquo;s take a look at the time complexity of the algorithm. Quicksort is a very difficult algorithm to analyze, especially since the selection of the pivot value is random and can greatly affect the performance of the algorithm. So, we&rsquo;ll talk about quicksort&rsquo;s time complexity in terms of two cases, the worst case and the average case. Let&rsquo;s look at the average case first</p>
<h2 id="average-case-complexity">Average case complexity</h2>
<p>What would the average case of quicksort look like? This is a difficult question to answer and requires a bit of intuition and making a few assumptions. The key really lies in how we choose our pivot value.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s assume that the data in our array is equally distributed. This means that the values are evenly spread between the lowest value and the highest value, with no large clusters of similar values anywhere. While this may not always be the case in the real world, often we can assume that our data is somewhat equally distributed.</p>
<p>Second, we can also assume that our chosen pivot value is close to the average value in the array. If the array is equally distributed and we choose a value at random, we have a $50\%$ chance of that value being closer to the average than either the minimum or the maximum value, so this is a pretty safe assumption.</p>
<p>With those two assumptions in hand, we see that something interesting happens. If we choose the average value as our pivot value, quicksort will perfectly partition the array into two equal sized halves! This is a great result, because it means that each recursive call to the function will be working with data that is half the initial array.</p>
<p>If we consider an array that initially contains $15$ elements, and make sure that we always choose the average element as our pivot point, we&rsquo;d end up with a tree of recursive calls that resembles the diagram below.</p>

<p>In this diagram, we see that each level of the tree looks at around $N$ elements. (It is actually fewer, but not by a significant amount so we can just round up to $N$ each time). We also notice that there are 4 levels to the tree, which is closely approximated by $\text{lg}(N)$. This is the same result we observed when analyzing the merge sort algorithm earlier in this module.</p>
<p>So, in the average case, we&rsquo;d say that quicksort runs in the order of $N * \text{lg}(N)$ time.</p>
<h2 id="worst-case-complexity">Worst case complexity</h2>
<p>To consider the worst-case situation for quicksort, we must come up with a way to define what the worst-case input would be. It turns out that the selection of our pivot value is the key here.</p>
<p>Consider the situation where the pivot value is chosen to be the maximum value in the array. What would happen in that case?</p>
<p>Looking at the code, we would see that each recursive call would contain one empty partition, and the other partition would be just one less than the size of the original array. So, if our original array only contained 8 elements, our tree recursion diagram would look similar to the following.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-01be6cba01b54208d732da866521b310" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Time Tree 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.20.quicktime2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-01be6cba01b54208d732da866521b310"><img alt="Quicksort Time Tree 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.20.quicktime2.png"></a></p>
<p>This is an entirely different result! In this case, since we are only reducing the size of our array by 1 at each level, it would take $N$ recursive calls to complete. However, at each level, we are looking at one fewer element. Is this better or worse than the average case?</p>
<p>It turns out that it is much worse. As we learned in our analysis of selection sort and bubble sort, the series</p>
$$
N + (N – 1) + (N – 2) + ... + 2 + 1
$$
<p>is best approximated by $N^2$. So, we would say that quicksort runs in the order of $N^2$ time in the worst case. This is just as slow as selection sort and bubble sort! Why would we ever call it &ldquo;quicksort&rdquo; if it isn&rsquo;t any faster?</p>
<p>Thankfully, in practice, it is very rare to run into this worst-case performance with quicksort, and in fact most research shows that quicksort is often the fastest of the four sorting algorithms we&rsquo;ve discussed so far. In the next section, we&rsquo;ll discuss these performance characteristics a bit more.</p>
<p>This result highlights why it is important to consider both the worst case and average case performance of our algorithms. Many times we&rsquo;ll write an algorithm that runs well most of the time, but is susceptible to poor performance when given a particular worst-case input.</p>

<h1 id="performance-of-sorting-algorithms">Performance of Sorting Algorithms</h1>

<p>We introduced four sorting algorithms in this chapter: selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, and quicksort. In addition, we performed a basic analysis of the time complexity of each algorithm. In this section, we&rsquo;ll revisit that topic and compare sorting algorithms based on their performance, helping us understand what algorithm to choose based on the situation.</p>
<h2 id="overall-comparison">Overall Comparison</h2>
<p>The list below shows the overall result of our time complexity analysis for each algorithm.</p>
<ol>
<li>Selection Sort: $N^2$</li>
<li>Bubble Sort: $N^2$</li>
<li>Merge Sort: $N * \text{lg}(N)$</li>
<li>Quicksort Average Case: $N * \text{lg}(N)$</li>
<li>Quicksort Worst Case: $N^2$</li>
</ol>
<p>We have expressed the amount of time each algorithm takes to complete in terms of the size of the original input $N$. But how does $N^2$ compare to $N * \text{lg}(N)$?</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to compare two functions is to graph them, just like we&rsquo;ve learned to do in our math classes. The diagram below shows a graph containing the functions $N$, $N^2$, and $N * \text{lg}(N)$.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-642310ff05370d20ce3315ebc1475294" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Graph 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.21.graph.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-642310ff05370d20ce3315ebc1475294"><img alt="Graph 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.21.graph.png"></a></p>
<p>First, notice that the scale along the X axis (representing values of $N$) goes from 0 to 10, while the Y axis (representing the function outputs) goes from 0 to 30. This graph has been adjusted a bit to better show the relationship between these functions, but in actuality they have a much steeper slope than is shown here.</p>
<p>As we can see, the value of $N^2$ at any particular place on the X axis is almost always larger than $N * \text{lg}(N)$, while that function&rsquo;s output is almost always larger than $N$ itself. We can infer from this that functions which run in the order of $N^2$ time will take much longer to complete than functions which run in the order of $N * \text{lg}(N)$ time. Likewise, the functions which run in the order of $N * \text{lg}(N)$ time themselves are much slower than functions which run in linear time, or in the order of $N$ time.</p>
<p>Based on that assessment alone, we might conclude that we should always use merge sort! It is guaranteed to run in $N * \text{lg}(N)$ time, with no troublesome worst-case scenarios to consider, right? Unfortunately, as with many things in the real world, it isn&rsquo;t that simple.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-sorting-algorithms">Choosing Sorting Algorithms</h2>
<p>The choice of which sorting algorithm to use in our programs largely comes down to what we know about the data we have, and how that information can impact the performance of the algorithm. This is true for many other algorithms we will write in this class. Many times there are multiple methods to perform a task, such as sorting, and the choice of which method we use largely depends on what we expect our input data to be.</p>
<p>For example, consider the case where our input data is nearly sorted. In that instance, most of the items are in the correct order, but a few of them, maybe less than $10\%$, are slightly out of order. In that case, what if we used a version of bubble sort that was optimized to stop sorting as soon as it makes a pass through the array without swapping any elements? Since only a few elements are out of order, it may only take a few passes with bubble sort to get them back in the correct places. So even though bubble sort runs in $N^2$ time, the actual time may be much quicker.</p>
<p>Likewise, if we know that our data is random and uniformly distributed, we might want to choose quicksort. Even though quicksort has very slow performance in the worst case, if our data is properly random and distributed, research shows that it will have better real-world performance than most other sorting algorithms in that instance.</p>
<p>Finally, what if we know nothing about our input data? In that case, we might want to choose merge sort as the safe bet. It is guaranteed to be no worse than $N * \text{lg}(N)$ time, even if the input is truly bad. While it might not be as fast as quicksort if the input is random, it won&rsquo;t run the risk of being slow, either.</p>

<h1 id="binary-search">Binary Search</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D64RE4R2keI">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve learned how to sort the data in our container, let&rsquo;s go back and revisit the concept of searching once again. Does our approach change when we know the data has been sorted?</p>
<p>Our intuition tells us that it should. Recall that we discussed how much easier it would be to find a particular paper in a sorted filing cabinet rather than just searching through a random pile of papers on the floor. The same concept applies to data in our programs.</p>
<p>The most commonly used searching algorithm when dealing with sorted data is <em>binary search</em>. The idea of the algorithm is to compare the value in the middle of the container with the value we are looking for. In this case, let&rsquo;s assume the container is sorted in ascending order, so the smaller elements are before the larger ones. If we compare our desired value with the middle value, there are three possible outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>the value in the middle is equal to the desired value. We have found the element!</li>
<li>the value in the middle is less than the desired value. Since the container is ordered in ascending order, we must search for the value in the second half of the container.</li>
<li>the value in the middle is greater than the desired value. Since the container is ordered in ascending order, we must search for the value in the first half of the container.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once an occurrence of the desired value is found, we can also look at the values before it to see if there any more of the desired values in the container. Since it is sorted, they should all be grouped together. If we want our algorithm to return the index of the first occurrence of the desired value, we can simply move toward the front of the array until we find that first occurrence.</p>
<h2 id="binary-search-example">Binary Search Example</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s work through a quick example of the binary search algorithm to see how it works in practice. Let&rsquo;s assume we have the array shown in the diagram below, which is already sorted in ascending order. We wish to find out if the array contains the value 5. So, we&rsquo;ll store that in our <code>value</code> variable. We also have variables <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> representing the first and last index in the array that we are considering.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-018be723e7415c3cd32805f58ecf2e32" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Binary Search Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.22.binary1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-018be723e7415c3cd32805f58ecf2e32"><img alt="Binary Search Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.22.binary1.png"></a></p>
<p>First, we must calculate the middle index of the array. To do that, we can use the following formula.</p>
$$
\text{int}((\text{start} + \text{end}) / 2)
$$
<p>In this case, we&rsquo;ll find that the middle index is 5.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-f6b5a6c9fde1e198095bca561647483b" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Binary Search Example 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.22.binary2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-f6b5a6c9fde1e198095bca561647483b"><img alt="Binary Search Example 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.22.binary2.png"></a></p>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll compare our desired value with the element at the middle index, which is 2. Since our desired value 5 is greater than 2, we know that 5 must be present in the second half of the array. We will then update our starting value to be one greater than the middle element and start over. In practice, this could be done either iteratively or recursively. We&rsquo;ll see both implementations later in this section. The portion of the array we are ignoring has been given a grey background in the diagram below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-4e9c33c3c6bea6c34776f9b7951d834f" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Binary Search Example 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.22.binary3.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Once again, we&rsquo;ll start by calculating a new middle index. In this case, it will be 8.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-a32e6c809240029b31e63d070cdb4ef5" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Binary Search Example 4" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.22.binary4.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-a32e6c809240029b31e63d070cdb4ef5"><img alt="Binary Search Example 4" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.22.binary4.png"></a></p>
<p>The value at index 8 is 7, which is greater than our desired value 5. So we know that 5 should be in the first half of the array from index 6 through 10. We need to update the end variable to be one less than middle and try once again.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-3336d1528e175bffd1cbb21d3cdd4850" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Binary Search Example 5" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.22.binary5.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-3336d1528e175bffd1cbb21d3cdd4850"><img alt="Binary Search Example 5" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.22.binary5.png"></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll first calculate the middle index, which will be 6. This is because (6 + 7) / 2 is 6.5, but when we convert it to an integer it will be truncated, resulting in just 6.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-db6906b2b39339d4ecb013db79ec6a42" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Binary Search Example 6" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.22.binary6.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-db6906b2b39339d4ecb013db79ec6a42"><img alt="Binary Search Example 6" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.22.binary6.png"></a></p>
<p>Since the value at index 6 is 4, which is less than our desired value 5, we know that we should be looking at the portion of the array which comes after our middle element. Once again, we&rsquo;ll update our start index to be one greater than the middle and start over.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-9c6d6827f09f36cb1ed9fa6109a847aa" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Binary Search Example 7" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.22.binary7.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-9c6d6827f09f36cb1ed9fa6109a847aa"><img alt="Binary Search Example 7" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.22.binary7.png"></a></p>
<p>In this case, since both <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are the same, we know that the middle index will also be 7.  We can compare the value at index 7 to our desired value. As it turns out, they are a match, so we&rsquo;ve found our value! We can just return <code>middle</code> as the index for this value. Of course, if we want to make sure it is the first instance of our desired value, we can quickly check the elements before it until we find one that isn&rsquo;t our desired value. We won&rsquo;t worry about that for now, but it is something that can easily be added to our code later.</p>

<p>This function starts by setting the initial values of <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> on lines 2 and 3 to the first and last indexes in the array, respectively. Then, the loop starting on line 4 will repeat while the <code>start</code> index is less than or equal to the <code>end</code> index. If we reach an instance where <code>start</code> is greater than <code>end</code>, then we have searched the entire array and haven&rsquo;t found our desired value. At that point the loop will end and we will return -1 on line 14.</p>
<p>Inside of the loop, we first calculate the <code>middle</code> index on line 5. Then on line 6 we check to see if the middle element is our desired value. If so, we should just return the <code>middle</code> index and stop. It is important to note that this function will return the index to an instance of <code>value</code> in the array, but it may not be the first instance. If we wanted to find the first instance, we&rsquo;d add a loop at line 7 to move forward in the array until we were sure we were at the first instance of <code>value</code> before returning.</p>
<p>If we didn&rsquo;t find our element, then the if statements on lines 8 and 10 determine which half of the array we should look at. Those statements update either <code>end</code> or <code>start</code> as needed, and then the loop repeats.</p>

<p>The recursive version moves the loop&rsquo;s termination condition to the base case, ensuring that it returns -1 if the <code>start</code> index is greater than the <code>end</code> index. Otherwise, it performs the same process of calculating the <code>middle</code> index and checking to see if it contains the desired <code>value</code>. If not, it uses the recursive calls on lines 10 and 12 to search the first half or second half of the array, whichever is appropriate.</p>

<h1 id="binary-search-time-complexity">Binary Search Time Complexity</h1>

<p>Analyzing the time complexity of binary search is similar to the analysis done with merge sort. In essence, we must determine how many times it must check the middle element of the array.</p>
<p>In the worst case, it will continue to do this until it has determined that the <code>value</code> is not present in the array at all. Any time that our array doesn&rsquo;t contain our desired value would be our worst-case input.</p>
<p>In that instance, how many times do we look at the middle element in the array? That is hard to measure. However, it might be easier to measure how many elements are in the array each time and go from there.</p>
<p>Consider the situation where we start with 15 elements in the array. How many times can we divide the array in half before we are down to just a single element? The diagram below shows what this might look like.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-e99e9ed844676261c5901b2c25c54fd8" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Binary Search Time Complexity" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.25.binarytime.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>As it turns out, this is similar to the analysis we did on merge sort and quick sort. If we divide the array in half each time, we will do this $\text{lg}(N)$ times. The only difference is that we are only looking at a single element, the shaded element, at each level. So the overall time complexity of binary search is on the order of $\text{lg}(N)$. That&rsquo;s pretty fast!</p>

<h1 id="the-importance-of-sorting">The Importance of Sorting</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09ziwYSD1vc">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go back and look at the performance of our sorting algorithms, now that we know how quickly binary search can find a particular value in an array. Let&rsquo;s add the function $\text{lg}(N)$ to our graph from earlier, shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-43fad5ef7b271c0dcb59f7553c22f775" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Graph 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.26.graph2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-43fad5ef7b271c0dcb59f7553c22f775"><img alt="Graph 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.26.graph2.png"></a></p>
<p>As we can see, the function $\text{lg}(N)$ is even smaller than $N$. So performing a binary search is much faster than a linear search, which we already know runs in the order of $N$ time.</p>
<p>However, performing a single linear search is still faster than any of the sorting algorithms we&rsquo;ve reviewed. So when does it become advantageous to sort our data?</p>
<p>This is a difficult question to answer since it depends on many factors. However, a good rule of thumb is to remember that the larger the data set, or the more times we need to search for a value, the better off we are to sort the data before we search.</p>
<p>In the graph below, the topmost line colored in red shows the approximate running time of $10$ linear search operations, while the bottom line in black shows the running time of performing a merge sort before $10$ binary search operations.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-b697bab31a7da8976d0588a9662efd6d" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Graph 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.26.graph3.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-b697bab31a7da8976d0588a9662efd6d"><img alt="Graph 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.26.graph3.png"></a></p>
<p>As we can see, it is more efficient to perform a merge sort, which runs in $N * \text{lg}(N)$ time, then perform $10$ binary searches running in $\text{lg}(N)$ time, than it is to perform $10$ linear searches running in $N$ time. The savings become more pronounced as the size of the input gets larger, as indicated by the X axis on the graph.</p>
<p>In fact, this analysis suggests that it may only take as few as 7 searches to see this benefit, even on smaller data sets. So, if we are writing a program that needs to search for a specific value in an array more than about 7 times, it is probably a good idea to sort the array before doing our searches, at least from a performance standpoint.</p>

<h1 id="searching--sorting-summary">Searching &amp; Sorting Summary</h1>

<p>In this chapter, we learned how to search for values in an array using a linear search method. Then, we explored four different sorting algorithms, and compared them based on their time complexity. Finally, we learned how we can use a sorted array to perform a faster binary search and saw how we can increase our performance by sorting our array before searching in certain situations.</p>
<p>Searching and sorting are two of the most common operations performed in computer programs, and it is very important to have a deep understanding of how they work. Many times the performance of a program can be improved simply by using the correct searching and sorting algorithms to fit the program&rsquo;s needs, and understanding when you might run into a particularly bad worst-case input.</p>
<p>The project in this module will involve implementing several of these algorithms in the language of your choice. As we learn about more data structures, we&rsquo;ll revisit these algorithms again to discuss how they can be improved or adapted to take advantage of different structures.</p>

<h1 id="what-are-hash-tables">What are Hash Tables?</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o6LDaTDdt4">YouTube Video</a>

<p>A hash table is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. The great thing about hash tables is that they provide efficient insertion, removal and lookup operations that arrays and linked lists cannot match, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieval operations in an unsorted array run in order $N$ time,</li>
<li>Retrieval operations in a sorted array using binary search run in constant time, but insertion operations run in order $N$ time, and</li>
<li>Insertion operations run in constant time in linked lists, but retrieval operations run in order $N$ time.</li>
</ul>
<p>A hash table consists of three components:</p>
<ol>
<li>An array that holds buckets where key-value pairs are stored,</li>
<li>A hash function that maps a key to a specific array index, and</li>
<li>A set of buckets that allow the hash table to store multiple key-value pairs whose keys map to the same index in the array; we implement our buckets using linked lists.</li>
</ol>
<p>A user basically stores a key-value pair in the hash table where the key is used to identify the key-value pair as well as compute where it will be stored. For instance, if we consider all the students in a university, we can store student information (name, address, phone, major, GPA, courses, etc.) in the hash table using their name as the key.
Storing a key-value pair in a hash table uses the following procedure.</p>
<ol>
<li>The user presents a key-value pair to be stored in the hash table.</li>
<li>The key is run through a hash function, which generates an index into the hash table&rsquo;s array.</li>
<li>The key-value pair is stored in the bucket (linked list) referenced at that index.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#R-image-5f10f964810940bae1a0de6df8748179" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Hash Table Linked List" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/11/11.1.list.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Retrieving a key-value pair from the hash table follows a similar procedure.</p>
<ol>
<li>The user presents the key to the key-value pair to be retrieved.</li>
<li>The key is run through a hash function, which generates an index into the hash table&rsquo;s array.</li>
<li>The bucket referenced at that index in the array is then searched for the appropriate key.</li>
<li>If found, the key-value pair is returned to the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally, it would be nice if there was only a single key-value pair stored in each bucket. However, we cannot guarantee this so we use a linked list to allow us to store multiple items whose key produces the same index.</p>
<h2 id="dictionaries">Dictionaries</h2>
<p>Another data type that is similar to hash tables and is built into many modern programming languages, is the <em>dictionary</em> or an <em>associative array</em>. A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs that is directly indexed by a key instead of an integer. These keys can be an integer, a string, or other data types. Dictionaries typically support the following operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a key-value pair to the collection,</li>
<li>Remove a key-value pair from the collection,</li>
<li>Modify an existing key-value pair in the collection, and</li>
<li>Lookup a value associated with a given key.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see dictionaries and hash tables are very similar in their basic operation. However, an important difference is that hash tables tend to allow any type of objects as the value in the key-value pairs, while dictionaries typically require a specific type of object to be the value. A dictionary can be implemented using a variety of data structures including linked lists and hash tables.</p>

<h1 id="hash-tables-in-code">Hash Tables in Code</h1>

<p>As stated previously, a hash table has three main components: an array, a hash function, and a set of buckets that store key-value pairs. We discuss the implementation of these below.</p>
<h2 id="array">Array</h2>
<p>We use an array to hold pointers to the buckets where the key-value pairs are stored. While the array itself is a common data type found in almost every language, there are some important aspects to the arrays used in hash tables.</p>
<p>First, the array must be large enough to store our key-value pairs without too many collisions. A collision occurs when two key-value pairs map to the same array index. Although we cannot keep this from happening, the fewer collisions, the faster the hash table. Thus, the larger the array, the lower the chance for collisions. We capture the size of the array as its <em>capacity</em>.</p>
<p>In the example below, both hash tables are storing the same number of key-value pairs. However, the capacity of the array on the right is more than twice as large as the one on the left. To retrieve a random key-value pair from each of these arrays requires a search of one of the linked list buckets. For the array on the left, the average number of nodes searched is $1.8$, while for the array on the right it is only $1.2$. Thus, in this example doubling the capacity of our array provides a $33\%$ reduction in the time required to retrieve a key-value pair. (Note that these statistics were computed based on these particular array capacities and the number of key-value pairs in the example.)</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-9e9c3ac8ce5c5e9e0f703eef1c1776f4" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Hash Table Capacity Examples" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/11/11.2.capacity.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-9e9c3ac8ce5c5e9e0f703eef1c1776f4"><img alt="Hash Table Capacity Examples" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/11/11.2.capacity.svg"></a></p>
<p>Second, the array should be re-sizable. Since we generally do not know in advance how many key-value pairs we have to store in our hash table, we need to be able to resize our array when the number of key-value pairs reaches a predefined threshold. This threshold is based on the loading factor, which we define next.</p>
<h2 id="load-factor">Load Factor</h2>
<p>As we store more key-value pairs in a hash table, the number of collisions will increase. The more collisions we have, the less efficient our hash table will become. Thus, at some point, it makes sense to increase the capacity of the array and <em>rehash</em> our table, which means we compute new indexes for all key-value pairs and add them into the new array. The question is, when is the appropriate time to do this?</p>
<p>Traditionally, we answer this question using a ratio of the capacity of the hash table array to the number of key-value pairs stored in the table. There are three key properties of hash tables that come into play here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>capacity</em> of the array,</li>
<li>The <em>size</em> of the hash tables in terms of the number of key-value pairs stored in the table,</li>
<li>The <em>load factor</em> (or ratio) between the size of the hash table and its capacity, $\text{size} / \text{capacity}$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, when the load factor reaches a specified threshold, we double the capacity of the array and then rehash the table using the new array. The load factor threshold we choose is a tradeoff between space and time. The larger the array, the more memory you use, but with fewer collisions. Obviously, using a smaller array increases the number of collisions as well as the time it takes to retrieve key-value pairs from the table. For our examples below, we use the standard default load factor of $0.75$.</p>
<h2 id="buckets">Buckets</h2>
<p>If our array was large enough to ensure our hash function would compute a unique index for each key (i.e., there would be absolutely no collisions), we could store the key-value pairs directly in the array. Unfortunately, this is almost never the case and collisions do occur. Therefore, we store the key-value pairs in buckets associated with each array index. <em>Buckets</em> are the general term we use to describe the mechanism we use to store key-value pairs and handle any collisions that occur. As shown in the figure below, we use linked lists to implement our buckets, which is a fairly standard approach.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-492dc9189929b3c7a7789626413b7a6b" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Hash Table Buckets" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/11/11.2.buckets.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-492dc9189929b3c7a7789626413b7a6b"><img alt="Hash Table Buckets" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/11/11.2.buckets.svg"></a></p>
<p>As we recall, linked lists provide constant time operations for adding key-value pairs to the list and linear time operations for retrieving key-value pairs from the list. While linear time seems slow for adding a key-value pair to the list, we need to remember that we are talking only about the number of key-value pairs in a specific list, not the total number of key-value pairs in the entire hash table. Thus, as shown in the figure above, the maximum number of key-value pairs in any linked list is $2$, even though the size of the entire table is $9$. With a load factor of $0.75$ and a good quality hash function that distributes key-value pairs uniformly across the array, our linked lists generally have a small number of items ($2$ or $3$ maximum) in each list. So, even though retrieving is not technically constant time, because it is very close to it in practice, we say that it is.</p>

<h1 id="hash-functions">Hash Functions</h1>

<p>A <em>hash function</em> converts a key into a hash code, which is an integer value that can be used to index our hash table array.  Obviously, there are some hash functions that are better than others. Specifically, a good hash function is both easy to compute and should uniformly distribute the keys across our hash table array. Both of these are important factors in how fast our hash table operates, since we compute a hash code each time we insert or get a key-value pair from the hash table. If it takes too long to compute the hash code, we lose the benefits of having constant time insertion and retrieval operations. Likewise, if the function does not distribute the keys evenly across the table, we end up with several keys in the same bucket, which causes longer times to retrieve key-value pairs.</p>
<p>A good hash function should have three important properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>Uniform: the input values should uniformly map to the output range.</li>
<li>Efficient: the hash function should be fast to compute.</li>
<li>Deterministic: the hash function should always compute the same value for a given input.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily, many modern programming languages provide native support for hash functions. Both Java and Python provide built-in hashing functions. These functions take any object and produce an integer, which we then use with the modulo operator to reduce it to the appropriate size for our array capacity. An example of how to use the Java <code>hashCode</code> function is shown below. More information on the Java <code>hashCode</code> function can be found <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-hashcode" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="box-content">

<p>Another interesting use of hash functions deals with storing and verifying passwords. When we sign up for an account on a website, it asks us for a password that we&rsquo;d like to use. Obviously, if that website just stored the password directly in their database, it could be a huge security problem if someone was able to gain access to that information. So, how can the website store a password in a way that prevents a hacker from learning our password, but the website can verify that we&rsquo;ve entered the correct password?</p>
<p>In many cases, we can use a hash function to do just that. When we first enter our password, the website calculates the hash code for the password and then stores the result in the database.</p>
<p>Then, when we try to log in to the website in the future, we provide the same password, and the website is able to calculate the hash again and verify that they match. As long as the hash function is properly designed, it is very unlikely for two passwords to result in the same hash, even if they are very similar.</p>

<p>In practice, most websites add additional random data to the password before hashing it, just to decrease the chances of two passwords hashing to the same value. This is referred to as &ldquo;salting&rdquo; the password.</p>

<h2 id="keys">Keys</h2>
<p>Keys allow us to easily differentiate between data items that have different values. For example, if we wanted to store student data such as first name, last name, date of birth, and identification number, it would be convenient to have one piece of data that could differentiate between all the students. However, some data are better suited to be keys than others. In general, the student&rsquo;s last name tends to be more selective than the first name. However, the student identification number is even better since it is guaranteed to be unique. When a key is guaranteed to be unique, we call them primary keys. The efficiency of a key is also important. Numeric keys are more efficient than alphanumeric keys since computing hash codes with numbers is faster than computing them with characters.</p>

<h1 id="tuples">Tuples</h1>

<p>Before we can start describing the basic hash table functions, we first need to create a way to handle key-value pairs. We generally refer to any piece of data that has two parts as a <code>tuple</code>. In the case of key-value pairs, our tuple would look like <code>(key, value)</code>. Some languages, such as Python, provide built-in support for creating tuples, while others such as Java and C# require us to create our own tuple class, which is easy to do. All we really need our <code>tuple</code> class to do is to allow us to:</p>
<ol>
<li>create a tuple consisting of two objects,</li>
<li>access either of the two parts of the tuple,</li>
<li>check two tuples for equality, and</li>
<li>convert the tuple to a string.</li>
</ol>
<p>The pseudocode for the <code>Tuple</code> class is given below. Each of the operations is simple and thus we do not discuss them individually. However, notice that the class has two attributes, <code>key</code> and <code>value,</code> that are created in the constructor. The <code>getKey</code> and <code>getValue</code> operations are used often in the code below to provide access to the internals of the tuples.</p>

<p>The <code>HashTable</code> class has three attributes that provide the basic data structure and parameters we need to efficiently manage our table.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>size</code> - captures the number of tuples stored in the table. It is initialized to <code>0</code> in line 11 of the constructor.</li>
<li><code>loadFactor</code> - is the load factor used to determine when to increase the capacity of the array. It is initialized to <code>0.75</code> in line 12 of the constructor.</li>
<li><code>hashTable</code> - is an array of doubly linked lists. The array is actually created in line 7 of the constructor and the doubly linked lists for each location in the array are created in the loop in lines 8 and 9 of the constructor.</li>

<h2 id="compute-index">Compute Index</h2>
<p>We assume we are using the language-specific hash code function to actually generate our hash code. However, we need to convert that number (typically a very large integer) to an index for our array, which has a limited capacity. Therefore, we use the modulo function in line 2 to convert the hash code into the range of <code>0</code> to the capacity of the array. The <code>computeIndex</code> operation runs in constant time.</p>

<h2 id="put">Put</h2>
<p>The <code>put</code> operation is an important hash table operation, whose goal is to place a key-value pair into the right linked list. We start by calling <code>computeIndex</code> to find which linked list we should store the key-value pair in, which we can access using <code>hashTable[index]</code>. Next, we check to see if the <code>key</code> has already been stored in the table by iterating through the list found at that location in the table. If the <code>key</code> has already been stored, we should update the value in that tuple to be the new value in line 9 and return on line 10. If the <code>key</code> isn&rsquo;t found, then we actually store the key-value pair in the table by calling the <code>append</code> operation for the <code>hashTable[index]</code> linked list on line 15. Notice, we create a new <code>Tuple</code> using the <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> input parameters before we call append. Since we successfully added the new tuple, we increment the <code>size</code> attribute to keep track of the number of tuples stored in the table.</p>

<p>Since we have added a new tuple to the table, we need to check to see if the size of the table exceeds our load factor. Therefore, in line 18, we check to see if the value of <code>size/capacity</code> exceeds our <code>loadFactor</code>. If it does, we call the <code>doubleCapacity</code> operation to double the capacity of our array and rehash the table. The <code>doubleCapacity</code> operation is defined below.</p>
<p>Since we are looping through a list of elements in the hash table, it can be difficult to analyze the running time of this method. So, we have to look at both the best case and worst case scenario. In the best case, the linked list is empty, so the entire operation runs in constant time. As long as we have a good hash function and the keys are equally distributed across the hash table, this should be the case.</p>
<p>However, if the hash function is poor, it could cause all of the elements in the hash table to be placed in the same list. In that case, the operation would run on the order of $N$ time, since it would have to iterate across all elements in the list.</p>
<h2 id="get">Get</h2>
<p>The <code>get</code> operation is another important hash table operation, whose goal is to retrieve (without deleting) a key-value pair from the table. Like the <code>put</code> operation, the first thing we need to do is to compute the index of the <code>key</code> we are looking for in line 2. Once we know the <code>index</code>, we call the <code>reset</code> operation on the <code>hashTable[index]</code> linked list so we can call the <code>getNext</code> iterator function in line 4. Lines 6 - 8 are a loop that walks through each key-value pair in the linked list. If we find the <code>key</code> we are looking for in line 7, we return <code>true</code> and the operation ends. If we do not find the <code>key</code>, we call the <code>getNext</code> function to get the next element in the linked list. If we end up going through the entire loop until <code>current != null</code> becomes false, we fall out of the loop and return null in line 13, indicating that we did not find <code>key</code> in the table.</p>

<p>As discussed above, although we do end up looping through one of the linked lists in the hash table, these lists are much, much smaller than the overall size of the hash table under most normal circumstances. Thus, we say that the <code>get</code> operation runs in constant time in the best case.</p>
<h2 id="remove">Remove</h2>
<p>The <code>remove</code> operation is much like the <code>get</code> operation above, except that when we find the <code>key</code> we are searching for, we remove the key-value pair from the appropriate linked-list and return the <code>value</code> to the calling function. The only real difference in the operations lies in the loop intervals in lines 8 and 9. Here, when we find the <code>key</code> in the list, we call the <code>removeCurrent</code> operation to remove the key-value pair from the linked list and then decrement size by 1. Line 10 then returns <code>current.value</code>.</p>

<p>Like the <code>get</code> operation above, we loop through one of the linked lists in the hash table. However, given the relatively small size of the list, we assume the <code>remove</code> operation runs in constant time in the best case.</p>
<h2 id="contains-key">Contains Key</h2>
<p>The <code>containsKey</code> operation returns a Boolean value based on whether we find the requested <code>key</code> in the table. Since the <code>get</code> operation already finds the key-value pair associated with a given <code>key</code>, we simply call <code>get</code> and then compute whether the key-value pair returned from <code>get</code> exists to compute the <code>containsKey</code> return value. The <code>containsKey</code> operation runs in constant time in the best case.</p>

<h2 id="contains-value">Contains Value</h2>
<p>The <code>containsValue</code> operation is not as simple as <code>containsKey</code> since we don&rsquo;t already have an operation to use  to search for a value in our hash table. Since we are not given a <code>key</code> to search for, we cannot use the <code>computeIndex</code> to tell us which linked list to search for our <code>value</code>. Therefore, we need to start at the beginning of our array and loop through each element, searching each of the linked lists stored there for our <code>value</code>.</p>
<p>Line 1 is our outside loop that walks through each linked list stored in our array. Within that  loop, we follow the same search process we used in the <code>get</code> operation to search through <code>hashTable[i]</code>. We set up the iterator in lines 3 and 4 and then walk through the linked list in the loop in lines 6 - 9. The only difference in this search process is what we are searching for. In line 7, instead of checking if the keys are equal, we check to see if the values are equal. If they are, we return true. However, if we do not find the value somewhere in the table, we must search through every key-value pair in the table, thus the time complexity for <code>containsValue</code> is order $N$.</p>

Line 2 creates the new empty hash table, which we call <code>copy</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>for</code> loop in line 4 walks through the <code>hashTable</code> array, allowing us to access each linked list using <code>hashTable[i]</code>. Within the loop we use the linked list iterator functions (lines 5, 6, and 10) to walk through each key-value pair in the linked lists. For each key-value pair, we call <code>copy.put</code> to insert that key-value pair into the <code>copy</code> hash table. Once we have completed both loops, we return the copy in line 14. Like the <code>containsValue</code> operation, since we walk through each key-value pair in the hash table, the <code>copy</code> operation runs in order $N$ time.</p>

<p>The <code>toString</code> operation is almost identical to the <code>copy</code> operation above, except that instead of inserting each key-value pair into a second hash table, we append the string representation of each key-value pair to an <code>output</code> string. In fact, the only differences to the pseudocode come in lines 2, 9, and 10. Line 2 creates a new empty string and line 13 returns that string after walking through the hash table. Finally, line 9 is where we append the current key-value pair&rsquo;s string representation to the <code>output</code> string.

<h2 id="double-capacity">Double Capacity</h2>
<p>The <code>doubleCapacity</code> operation is similar to the same operations for the array-based stack and queue implementations that we covered earlier. First, we create a new array with twice the capacity of the existing <code>hashTable</code>. Next, we &ldquo;rehash&rdquo; each of the key-value pairs in <code>hashTable</code> into the new table. Finally, we point the <code>hashTable</code> attribute at the new table.</p>
<p>The implementation of this process is captured in the following pseudocode. In line 2, we double the size of <code>capacity</code>. It is important to update <code>capacity</code> first so we can use the new value when creating the new hash table array. It is especially important to use this new capacity when calculating the indexes for key-value pairs in the new table.</p>

<p>Line 2 creates a new array called <code>newTable</code> with twice the capacity of the existing table. In lines 5 and 6, we create a new doubly linked list for each element of <code>newTable</code>.  Then, in lines 9 - 16 we employ the same looping structure used above in <code>copy</code> and <code>toString</code> to walk through each key-value pair in <code>hashTable</code>. Then for each key-value pair, we compute its new <code>index</code> and then append the key-value pair to the linked list at <code>hashTable[index]</code>.  Once we have completed the copying process, we fall out of the loop. Our final action is to point the <code>hashTable</code> attribute at <code>newTable</code>. Like the <code>copy</code> and <code>toString</code> operations, the run time of <code>doubleCapacity</code> is order $N$.</p>
<h2 id="iterator-operations">Iterator Operations</h2>
<p>While we do not present the iterator operations here, they are useful operations for hash tables. They are implemented similarly to the other iterator functions we have studied, except that in order to walk through the entire hash table we need to use nested loops where the outside loop walks through the array and the internal loop walks through each linked list. This is very similar to the looping structure in <code>doubleCapacity</code> above.</p>

<h1 id="hash-table-based-sets">Hash Table Based Sets</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5TWEWJgJkk">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In this section, we walk through the pseudocode for some basic set operations built on our hash table class above. In this new version of the set class, we declare <code>mySet</code> as a hash table and use that throughout our operations.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">mySet = new HashTable()</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When using a hash table to implement sets, one of the most important choices we must make is what to use for a key. This is really difficult in the case of sets since we do not know exactly what types of objects may be put into the set. Our only real option at this point is just to use the entire object as our key. Our choice to use a default hash function in our hash table turns out to be a good one (at least in modern languages such as Python, Java, and C#), since most default hash functions work on any type of objects.</p>
<p>Next, we discuss the implementation of the important set operations using hash tables.</p>
<h2 id="contains">Contains</h2>
<p>The <code>contains</code> operation is straightforward since we are using the entire object as the key. We simply return the value from the hash table <code>containsKey</code> operation, which performs the exact function we need.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function contains(object o) returns boolean
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    return mySet.containsKey(o)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="add">Add</h2>
<p>The <code>add</code> operation maps almost exactly to the hash table <code>put</code> operation except that the <code>put</code> operation does not return a boolean value. So, we first check to see if the key is already contained in the hash table. If so, we just return <code>false</code>, since we don&rsquo;t need to add the value to the set. Otherwise, we add a new tuple to the hash table, and then return <code>true</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function add(object o) returns boolean
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    if mySet.containsKey(o)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return false
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end if
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    mySet.put(o, o)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    return true
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="remove">Remove</h2>
<p>The set <code>remove</code> operation maps almost exactly to the hash table <code>remove</code> operation, so we just call it and then check to see if the result is not null. If it is null, we will return <code>false</code> since the element was not in the set; otherwise we return <code>true</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function remove(object o) returns boolean
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    return mySet.remove(o) != null
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="intersection">Intersection</h2>
<p>The <code>intersection</code> operation creates a new set that has only elements which exist in both sets under consideration. In code, we basically accomplish this by looping through the elements in one set and then checking to see if they exist in the other set. If they do, then we include them in the intersection.</p>
<p>The pseudocode follows that basic algorithm using the hash table iterator to loop through and look at each element in <code>set1</code>.  We start by creating a new set, <code>result,</code> to hold the intersection of <code>set1</code> and <code>set2</code> in line 2. Then we get the first element pair from <code>set1</code> by calling the hash table <code>reset</code> operation in line 2 and the <code>getNext</code> operation in line 3.</p>

<p>Lines 6 - 10 implement the loop that walks through each element in <code>set1</code>. If the current element is contained in <code>set2</code> (line 7), the operation calls the <code>add</code> operation to insert the key of the <code>current</code> element into the <code>result</code> set. Line 10 gets the next element from <code>set1</code> and loops back to the top.
Eventually, we look at each element in <code>set1</code> and fall out of the loop. When that happens, the intersection operation is complete, and it returns the <code>result</code> set in line 13.</p>
<h2 id="union">Union</h2>
<p>The <code>union</code> operation is similar to the <code>intersection</code> operation in that we need to use the hash table iterator operations to walk through our sets. The difference lies in what we include in the new <code>result</code> set. While we only walked through <code>set1</code> in the <code>intersection</code> operation, picking only those objects that existed in <code>set2</code>, here we start by copying all elements from <code>set2</code> into the <code>result</code> set and then walk through <code>set1</code> adding each of its elements to the <code>result</code> set as well. (Here we don&rsquo;t need to worry about adding duplicates since the <code>add</code> operation takes care of that for us.)</p>
<p>The code starts in line 2 by making a <code>copy</code> of <code>set2</code> and assigning it to our new <code>result</code> set. Then, lines 4 and 5 reset the <code>set1</code> iterator and get the first item from <code>set1</code>. Lines 6 - 8 form the <code>while</code> loop that we use to walk through each element in <code>set1</code>. This time, however, we simply add every element we find in line 7 before getting the next object in line 8. Once the loop exists we are done and we return the <code>result</code> set in line 11.</p>

<h2 id="issubset">isSubset</h2>
<p>The <code>isSubset</code> operation below is very much like the <code>intersection</code> operation above as we have a loop in lines 4 - 8 that checks each element of <code>set1</code> and checks to see if it is in <code>set2</code>. The difference between the two operations is that in the <code>isSubset</code> operation, we do not build a third <code>result</code> set. Instead, if any element in <code>set1</code> is not found in <code>set2</code>, then we return <code>false</code> since not all elements of <code>set1</code> are contained in <code>set2</code>. If we get all the way through the loop, we have checked that each element in <code>set1</code> was found in <code>set2</code> and we can return <code>true</code>; <code>set1</code> is a subset of <code>set2</code>.</p>

<h1 id="hash-tables-summary">Hash Tables Summary</h1>

<p>In this module, we introduced the concept of a hash table, which is a data structure that provides efficient insertion and retrieval operations. We introduced the three essential elements of hash tables:</p>
<ol>
<li>An array that holds buckets where key-value pairs are stored,</li>
<li>A hash function that maps a key to a specific array index, and</li>
<li>A set of buckets that allow the hash table to store multiple key-value pairs whose keys map to the same index in the array.</li>
</ol>
<p>We then discussed how to implement a hash table class. In our implementation, we chose to use built-in, language-specific hash code functions to generate the indexes into our array. We also used doubly linked lists to implement our buckets as linked lists are very flexible and provide constant time insertion operations.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of hash tables, we re-implemented our set class using hash tables instead of linked lists. In many ways, the re-implementation was almost identical to the linked list implementation since many of the operations found in hash tables are almost identical to those found in linked lists. We also noted that the biggest advantage of implementing sets with hash tables is the (almost!) constant time retrieval operations provided by hash tables.</p>

<h1 id="choosing-the-right-structures">Choosing the Right Structures</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP_7u0Aw10w">YouTube Video</a>

<p>There are several linear data structures that we can use in our programs, including stacks, queues, lists, sets, and hash tables. In this course, we have covered each of these structures in detail. However, as a programmer, one of the most difficult decisions we will make when developing a program is the choice of which data structure to use. Sometimes the choice may be obvious based on the data we plan to store or the algorithms we need to perform, but in practice that happens very rarely. Instead, we are faced with competing tradeoffs between various factors such as ease of use, performance, and simplicity.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll review the various data structures and algorithms we&rsquo;ve learned about in this course, but this time we&rsquo;ll add a bit more focus on the decisions a programmer would make when choosing to use a particular data structure or algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="three-important-questions">Three Important Questions</h2>
<p>The choice of which data structure to use is often the most consequential choice we make when developing a new piece of software, as it can have a large impact on the overall performance of the program. While there are many different factors to consider, here are three important questions we can ask when choosing a data structure:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Does it Work?</strong> Above all else, the choice of a data structure must allow the program to complete its work correctly. If the program cannot function properly due to the choice of data structure, then all other factors can effectively be ignored. So, when developing a new program, we should first focus on choosing a data structure that we know will be able to complete the task. Thankfully, with a bit of programming ingenuity, most data structures can be used to complete most tasks, albeit poorly or inefficiently. In those cases, the next two questions will help us further narrow our choice.</li>
<li><strong>Is it Understandable?</strong> Once we have chosen a few data structures to analyze, the next factor we must deal with is understandability. If we cannot understand how to use our chosen data structure to perform the task, or if the method we use is so complex that it is difficult for us to explain to others, it is very likely that we&rsquo;ve made a poor choice. In most cases, the best choice of data structure will lead to the most straightforward and understandable implementation. The only exceptions to this are cases where we must deal with extremes of performance or limits on capability. In those extreme cases, many times a more complex answer ends up being the best one due to the limitations imposed on the system.</li>
<li><strong>Is it Performant?</strong> In programming, we use the term performant to characterize programs that exhibit a high level of performance and efficiency. So, when choosing a data structure to use in our program, we may want to choose one that is most likely to exhibit high levels of performance and efficiency while we use it. As we have learned throughout this course, different data structures are developed with different uses in mind, and it is a very good idea for us to keep that in mind when making our choice. In this chapter, we will spend some time reviewing these performance and efficiency factors for the various data structures we have covered so far, helping us make more informed choices.</li>
</ol>
<p>By answering the questions above in the order they are presented, we should be able to make good decisions about which data structures would work best in our program. We are purposely putting more focus on writing working and understandable code instead of worrying about performance. This is because many programs are only used with small data sets on powerful modern computers, so performance is not the most important aspect. However, there are instances where performance becomes much more important, and in those cases more focus can be placed on finding the most performant solution as well.</p>
<p>As it turns out, these three questions are very similar to a classic (trilemma)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma] from the world of business, as shown in the diagram below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-e265471c43cbb5edd674802fb91afd59" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Trilemma Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.1.trilemma.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-e265471c43cbb5edd674802fb91afd59"><img alt="Trilemma Diagram" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.1.trilemma.svg"></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In the world of software engineering, it is said that the process of developing a new program can only have two of the three factors of &ldquo;good&rdquo;, &ldquo;fast&rdquo;, and &ldquo;cheap&rdquo;. The three questions above form a similar trilemma. Put another way, there will always be competing tradeoffs when selecting a data structure for our programs.</p>
<p>For example, the most performant option may not be as easy to understand, and it may be more difficult to debug and ensure that it works correctly. A great example of this is matrix multiplication, a very common operation in the world of high-performance computing. A simple solution requires just three loops and is very easy to understand. However, the most performant solution requires hundreds of lines of code, assembly instructions, and a deep understanding of the hardware on which the program will be executed. That program will be fast and efficient, but it is much more difficult to understand and debug.</p>

<h1 id="data-structure-performance">Data Structure Performance</h1>

<p>Data structures that are used in our programs can be characterized in terms of two performance attributes: processing time and memory usage.</p>
<p>We will not worry about memory usage at this point, since most of the memory used in these data structures is consumed by the data that we are storing. More technically, we would say that the memory use of a data structure containing N elements is on the order of $N$ size. However, some structures, such as doubly linked lists, must maintain both the next and previous pointers along with each element, so there can be a significant amount of memory overhead. That is something we should keep in mind, but only in cases where we are dealing with a large amount of data and are worried about memory usage.</p>
<p>When evaluating the processing time of a data structure, we are most concerned with the algorithms used to add, remove, access, and find elements in the data structure itself. There are a couple of ways we can evaluate these operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empirically</strong> – we can simply measure the real-world time it takes to perform these actions on the data we are expecting our program to process, and then review the results in a spreadsheet or plot them on a graph to compare them. This gives us a good idea of how well the program will work, but it does not give us a very deep understanding of why the data structure performs that way.</li>
<li><strong>Mathematically</strong> – the other option is to mathematically evaluate the algorithm by reviewing the code and determining the order of time it takes relative to the size of the input. While this does not give us an actual, real-world value for the time it takes to perform an operation, it allows us to easily compare different operations and data structures based on how they&rsquo;d perform given the same size of input. We typically discuss both the best-case and worst-case processing times for each operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this course, we have included mathematical descriptions of the processing time of most major operations on the data structures we have covered.</p>

<h1 id="comparing-data-structures">Comparing Data Structures</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxn0f78fH0w">YouTube Video</a>

<p>One of the best ways to compare data structures is to look at the common operations that they can perform. For this analysis, we&rsquo;ve chosen to analyze the following four operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insert</strong> – inserting a specific element into the structure, either in sorted order, or at the appropriate place as required by the definition of a stack or queue.</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong> – accessing a desired element. For general data structures, this is the process of accessing an element by its index or key in the structure. For stacks and queues, this is the process of accessing the next element to be returned.</li>
<li><strong>Find</strong> – this is the process of finding a specific element in the data structure, usually by iterating through it or using a binary search method if the structure is sorted</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong> – this is the process of deleting a specific element in the case of a general-purpose structure or deleting and returning the next element in the case of a stack or queue.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table compares the best- and worst-case processing time for many common data structures and operations, expressed in terms of $N$, the number of elements in the structure.</p>

<p>We can also compare these processing times by graphing the equations used to describe them. The graph below shows several of the common orders that we have seen so far.</p>

<h2 id="unsorted-linked-list">Unsorted Linked List</h2>
<p><a href="#R-image-c6cbbada6028b12e4fc7e0f851a5cfaf" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Unsorted Linked List" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.5.ulist.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-c6cbbada6028b12e4fc7e0f851a5cfaf"><img alt="Unsorted Linked List" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.5.ulist.png"></a></p>
<p>The next data structure we learned about is the linked list. Specifically, we will look at the doubly linked list in this example, but in most instances the performance of a singly linked list is comparable.</p>
<p>With a linked list, the process of inserting an element at either the beginning or the end is a constant time operation since we maintain both a head and a tail reference. All we must do is create a new node and update a few references and we are good to go.</p>
<p>However, if we would like to access a specific element somewhere in the list, we will have to iterate through the list starting from either the head or the tail until we find the element we need. So, that operation runs in order $N$ time. This is the major difference between linked lists and arrays: with an array, we can directly access items using the array index, but with linked lists we must iterate to get to that element. This becomes important in the next section when we discuss the performance of a sorted linked list.</p>
<p>Similarly, the process of finding an element also requires iterating through the list, which is an operation that runs in order $N$ time.</p>
<p>Finally, if we want to find and delete an element, that also runs in order $N$ time since we must search through the list to find the element. Once we have found the element, the process of deleting that element is a constant time operation. So, if we use our list iterator methods in an efficient manner, the actual run time may be more efficient than this analysis would lead us to believe.</p>
<h2 id="sorted-linked-list">Sorted Linked List</h2>
<p><a href="#R-image-8fde2c6541b0359e1038e64e06e409c0" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Sorted Linked List" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.5.slinked.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-8fde2c6541b0359e1038e64e06e409c0"><img alt="Sorted Linked List" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.5.slinked.png"></a></p>
<p>We have not directly analyzed the performance of a sorted linked list in this course, but hopefully the analysis makes sense based on what we have learned before. Since the process of iterating through a linked list runs in order of $N$ time, every operation required to build a sorted linked list is limited by that fact.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to insert an element into a list in sorted order, we must simply iterate through the list to find the correct location to insert it. Once we&rsquo;ve found it, the process of inserting is actually a constant time operation since we don&rsquo;t have to shift any elements around, but because we can&rsquo;t use binary search on a linked list, we don&rsquo;t have any way to take advantage of the fact that the list is sorted.</p>
<p>The same problem occurs when we want to search for a particular element. Since we cannot use binary search to jump around between various elements in the list, we are limited to a simple linear search process, which runs in order of $N$ time.</p>
<p>Likewise, when we want to search and delete an element from the list, we must once again iterate through the entire list, resulting in an operation that runs in order $N$ time.</p>
<p>So, is there any benefit to sorting a linked list? Based on this analysis, not really! The purpose of sorting a collection is simply to make searching for a particular element faster. However, since we cannot use array indices to jump around a list like we can with an array, we do not see much of an improvement.</p>
<p>However, in the real world, we can improve some of these linear algorithms by &ldquo;short-circuiting&rdquo; them. When we &ldquo;short-circuit&rdquo; an algorithm, we provide additional code that allows the algorithm to return early if it realizes that it will not succeed.</p>
<p>For example, if we are searching for a particular element in a sorted list, we can add an if statement to check and see if the current element is greater than the element we are searching for. If the list is sorted in ascending order, we know that we have gone past the location where we expected to find our element, so we can just return without checking the rest of the list. While this does not change the mathematical analysis of the running time of this operation, it may improve the real-world empirical analysis of the operation.</p>
<h2 id="linked-list-stack-lifo-and-linked-list-queue-fifo">Linked List Stack (LIFO) and Linked List Queue (FIFO)</h2>
<p><a href="#R-image-2901e1ca410f2c4445215d911f79ddcc" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Unsorted Linked List" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.5.ulist.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-2901e1ca410f2c4445215d911f79ddcc"><img alt="Unsorted Linked List" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.5.ulist.png"></a></p>
<p>We already saw how to use the operations from a linked list to implement both a stack and a queue. Since those data structures restrict the operations we can perform a bit, it turns out that we can use a linked list to implement a stack and a queue with comparable performance to an array implementation.</p>
<p>For example, inserting, accessing, and removing elements in a stack or a queue based on a doubly linked list are all constant time operations, since we can use the head and tail references in a doubly linked list to avoid the need to iterate through the entire list to perform those operations. In fact, the only time we would have to iterate through the entire list is when we want to find a particular element in the stack or the queue. However, since we cannot sort a stack or a queue, finding an element runs in order $N$ time, which is comparable to an array implementation.</p>
<p>By limiting the actions we want to perform with our linked list, we can get a level of performance similar to an array implementation of a stack or a queue. It is a useful outcome that demonstrates the ability of different data structures to achieve similar outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="hash-tables">Hash Tables</h2>
<p><a href="#R-image-3183aae5cad91d7e468a954da65124b8" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Hash Table" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.6.hashtable.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-3183aae5cad91d7e468a954da65124b8"><img alt="Hash Table" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.6.hashtable.svg"></a></p>
<p>Analyzing the performance of a hash table is a bit trickier than the other data structures, mainly due to how a hash table tries to use its complex structure to get a &ldquo;best of both worlds&rdquo; performance outcome.</p>
<p>For example, consider the insert operation. In the best case, the hash table has a capacity that is large enough to guarantee that there are not any hash collisions. Each entry in the array of the hash table will be an empty list and inserting an element into an empty list is done in constant time, so the whole operation runs in the order of constant time.</p>
<p>The worst case for inserting an item into a hash table would be when every element has the same hash, so every element in the hash table is contained in the same list. In that case, we must iterate through the entire list to make sure the key has not already been used, which would be in the order of $N$ time.</p>
<p>Thankfully, if we properly design our hash table such that the capacity is much larger than our expected size, and the hash function we use to hash our keys results in a properly distributed hash, this worst case scenario should happen very rarely, if ever. Therefore, our expected performance should be closer to constant time.</p>
<p>One important thing to remember, however, is that each operation in a hash table requires computing the hash of the key given as input. Therefore, while some operations may run in constant time, if the action of computing the hash is costly, the overall operation may run very slowly.</p>
<p>The analysis of the operation to access a single element in a hash table based on a given key is similar. If the hash table elements are distributed across the table, then each list should only contain a single element. In that case, we can just compute the hash of the key and determine if that key has been used in a single operation, which runs in the order of constant time.</p>
<p>In the worst case, however, we once again have the situation where all the elements have been placed in the same linked list. We would need to iterate through each element to find the one we are looking for. In that case, the operation would run in the order of $N$ time.</p>
<p>The operation for finding a specific element in a hash table is a bit unique. In this case, we are discussing looking for a particular value, not necessarily a particular key. That operation is discussed in the previous paragraph. For the operation, the only possible way forward is to iterate through each list in the hash table and perform a linear search for the requested value, which will always run in order $N$ time.</p>
<p>Finally, if we want to delete a single element from a hash table based on a given key, the analysis is the same as inserting or finding an element. In the best case, it runs in the order of constant time, but the worst case runs in the order of N time since we must iterate through an entire list of $N$ elements.</p>
<p>Even though a hash table has some very poor performance in the worst case, as discussed earlier those worst case situations are very rare, and as long as we are careful about how we manage the capacity of our hash table and how we compute the hash of our objects, we can expect to see operations running in near constant time during normal usage.</p>

<h1 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu5SPVUescU">YouTube Video</a>

<p>We can examine the performance of the algorithms we use in a similar manner. Once again, we are concerned with both the memory usage and processing time of the algorithm. In this case, we are concerned with the amount of memory required to perform the algorithm that is above and beyond the memory used to store the data in the first place.</p>
<p>When analyzing searching and sorting algorithms, we&rsquo;ll assume that we are using arrays as our data structure, since they give us the best performance for accessing and swapping random elements quickly.</p>
<h2 id="searching">Searching</h2>
<p>There are two basic searching algorithms: linear search and binary search.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-0923791d5bb62c2e5651a1200f797ae7" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Linear Search" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.7.linear.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-0923791d5bb62c2e5651a1200f797ae7"><img alt="Linear Search" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.7.linear.png"></a></p>
<p>For linear search, we are simply iterating through the entire data structure until we find the desired item. So, while we can stop looking as soon as it is found, in the worst case we will have to look at all the elements in the structure, meaning the algorithm runs in order $N$ time.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-20e84ac36304dfe214546df821c2b161" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Binary Search" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.7.binary.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-20e84ac36304dfe214546df821c2b161"><img alt="Binary Search" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.7.binary.png"></a></p>
<p>Binary search, on the other hand, takes advantage of a sorted array to jump around quickly. In effect, each element we analyze allows us to eliminate half of the remaining elements in our search. With as few as 8 steps, we can search through an array that contains 64 elements. When we analyze this algorithm, we find that it runs in order $\text{lg}(N)$ time, which is a vast improvement over binary search.</p>
<p>Of course, this only works when we can directly access elements in the middle of our data structure. So, while a linked list gives us several performance improvements over an array, we cannot use binary search effectively on a linked list.</p>
<p>In terms of memory usage, since both linear search and binary search just rely on the original data structures for storing the data, the extra memory usage is constant and consists of just a couple of extra variables, regardless of how many elements are in the data structure.</p>
<h2 id="sorting">Sorting</h2>
<p>We have already discussed how much of an improvement binary search is over a linear search. In fact, our analysis showed that performing as few as 7 or 8 linear searches will take more time than sorting the array and using binary search. Therefore, in many cases we may want to sort our data. There are several different algorithms we can use to sort our data, but in this course we explored four of them: selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, and quicksort.</p>
<p>The selection sort algorithm involves finding the smallest or largest value in an array, then moving that value to the appropriate end, and repeating the process until the entire array is sorted. Each time we iterate through the array, we look at every remaining element. In the module on sorting, we showed (through some clever mathematical analysis) that this algorithm runs in the order of $N^2$ time.</p>
<p>Bubble sort is similar, but instead of finding the smallest or largest element in each iteration, it focuses on just swapping elements that are out of order, and eventually (through repeated iterations) sorting the entire array. While doing so, the largest or smallest elements appear to &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; to the appropriate end of the array, which gives the algorithm its name. Once again, because the bubble sort algorithm repeatedly iterates through the entire data structure, it also runs on the order of $N^2$ time.</p>
<p>Both selection sort and bubble sort are inefficient as sorting algorithms go, yet their main value is their simplicity. They are also very nice in that they do not require any additional memory usage to run. They are easy to implement and understand and make a good academic example when learning about algorithms. While they are not used often in practice, later in this module we will discuss a couple of situations where we may consider them useful.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-25f82f63b91fe0a4a07bae0551726e76" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Merge Sort" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.7.merge.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-25f82f63b91fe0a4a07bae0551726e76"><img alt="Merge Sort" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/12.7.merge.png"></a></p>
<p>Merge sort is a very powerful divide and conquer algorithm, which splits the array to be sorted into progressively smaller parts until each one contains just one or two elements. Then, once those smaller parts are sorted, it slowly merges them back together until the entire array is sorted. We must look at each element in the array at least once per &ldquo;level&rdquo; of the algorithm in the diagram above, so overall this algorithm runs in the order of $N * \text{lg}(N)$ time. This is quite a bit faster than selection sort and bubble sort. However, most implementations of merge sort require at least a second array for storing data as it is merged together, so the additional memory usage is also on the order of $N$.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-07c1998dedbf6b1562fb0d1ce93a0df8" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Quicksort Best Case" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/7.20.quicktime.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-07c1998dedbf6b1562fb0d1ce93a0df8"><img alt="Quicksort Best Case" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/12/7.20.quicktime.png"></a></p>
<p>Quicksort is a very clever algorithm, which involves selecting a &ldquo;pivot&rdquo; element from the data, and then dividing the data into two halves, one containing all elements less than the pivot, and another with all items greater than the pivot. Then, the process repeats on each half until the entire structure is sorted.
In the ideal scenario, shown in the diagram above, quicksort runs on the order of $N * \text{lg}(N)$ time, similar to merge sort. However, this depends on the choice of the pivot element being close to the median element of the structure, which we cannot always guarantee. Thankfully, in practice, we can just choose a random element (such as the last element in the structure) and we&rsquo;ll see performance that is close to the $N * \text{lg}(N)$ target.</p>

<p>However, if we choose our pivot element poorly, the worst case scenario shown in the diagram above can occur, causing the run time to be on the order of $N^2$ instead. This means that quicksort has a troublesome, but rare, worst case performance scenario.</p>

<h1 id="choosing-an-algorithm">Choosing an Algorithm</h1>

<p>There are many different algorithms we can use to sort our data, and some of them can be shown mathematically to be more efficient, even in the worst case. So, how should we choose which algorithm to use?</p>
<p>In practice, it really comes down to a variety of factors, based on the amount of data we expect our program to handle, the randomness of the data, and more. The only way to truly know which algorithm is the best is to empirically test all of them and choose the fastest one, but even that approach relies on us predicting the data that our program will be utilizing.</p>
<p>Instead, here are some general guidelines we can use to help us select a sorting algorithm to use in our program.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we know that the data will be nearly sorted, with only a few elements out of place, we can use <strong>bubble sort</strong> to quickly fix those issues. Unlike many other sorting algorithms, it is very easy to modify the bubble sort code to terminate when the data is properly sorted after just a few iterations. While it is rare to find a data set that is nearly sorted, it is an interesting case to be aware of.</li>
<li>If we think our data will be truly random, or if we are not sure we have enough memory to store the data twice, we can use <strong>quicksort</strong> effectively. Since the data is random, we should avoid the worst case scenario that can happen when using quicksort. In most cases quicksort is one of the fastest sorting algorithms when used on real-world data.  In addition, quicksort does not have any additional memory requirements, so it can be used in place without creating a copy of the data.</li>
<li>If we are not sure what features our data will have, but we know we&rsquo;ll have enough memory to store the data twice, then <strong>merge sort</strong> is a good choice. Merge sort guarantees that the performance will be on the order of $N \text{lg}(N)$ regardless of how the data is structured, but it typically requires more memory usage.</li>
<li>Interestingly, if we are dealing with a large set of data that will not fit in memory itself, <strong>merge sort</strong> is also a good choice. Merge sort was originally designed for sorting data stored on multiple removable disks or tapes. Each disk was sorted individually, and then two disks could be merged in sorted order on two more disks. Over time, the entire data set could be sorted by using just a few extra disks, even if it could not all be loaded into the computer at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the choice of which sorting algorithm to use is one of the most important decisions a programmer can make, and it is a great example of the fact that there are multiple ways to write a program that performs a particular task. Each possible program comes with various performance and memory considerations, and in many cases, there may not be a correct option. Instead, we must rely on our own knowledge and insight to choose the method that we feel would work best in any given situation.</p>

<h1 id="data-structure-uses">Data Structure Uses</h1>

<p>Throughout this course, we have looked at a few ways we can use the data structures we have already learned to do something useful. In this module, we will look at a few of those examples again, as well as a few more interesting uses of the data structures that we have built.</p>
<h2 id="arrays-and-linked-lists-as-stacks-queues-and-sets">Arrays and Linked Lists as Stacks, Queues, and Sets</h2>
<p>First and foremost, it is important to understand that we can implement many of the simpler data structures such as stacks, queues and sets using both arrays and linked lists. In fact, from a certain point of view, there are only two commonly used containers for data – the array and the linked list. Nearly all other data structures are a variant of one of those two approaches or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Earlier in this chapter, we discussed some of the performance implications that arise when using arrays or linked lists to implement stacks and queues. In practice, we need to understand how we will be using our data in order to choose between the two approaches.</p>
<h2 id="sets-in-compilers-and-interpreters">Sets in Compilers and Interpreters</h2>
<p>One unique use of sets appears in the code of compilers and interpreters. In each case, a programming language can only have one instance of a variable with a given name at any one time. So, we can think of the variables in a program as a set. In the code for a compiler or interpreter, we might find many instances of sets that are used to enforce rules that require each variable or function name to be unique.</p>
<p>Of course, this same property becomes important in even larger data storage structures, such as a relational database. For example, a database may include a column for a username or identification number which must be unique, such that no two entries can be the same. Once again, we can use a set to help enforce that restriction.</p>
<h2 id="hash-tables-as-sets-and-indexers">Hash Tables as Sets and Indexers</h2>
<p>Hash tables are a great example of a data structure that effectively combines arrays and linked lists to increase performance. The best way to understand this is through the analysis of a set implemented using a hash table instead of a linked list.</p>
<p>When we determine if an element is already contained in a set based on a linked list, we must perform a linear search which runs on the order of $N$ time. The same operation performed on a set based on a hash table runs in constant time in the best case. This is because we can use the result of the hash function to jump directly to the bucket where the item should be stored, if it exists.</p>
<p>This same trick is used in large relational databases. If we have a database with a million rows, we can define an <em>index</em> for a column that allows us to quickly jump to entries without searching the entire database. To look up a particular entry using an index, we can calculate its hash, find the entry in the index, and then use the link in that index element to find the record in the database.</p>
<p>Finally, we can also use hash tables to build efficient indexes for large amounts of text data. Consider a textbook, for example. Most textbooks contain an index in the back that gives the page locations where particular terms are discussed. How can we create that index? We can iterate through each word in the textbook, but for each one we will have to search through the existing words in the index to see if that page is already listed for that word. That can be very slow if we must use a linear search through a linked list. However, if we use a hash table to store the index, the process of updating entries can be done in nearly constant time!</p>

<h1 id="python-standard-types">Python Standard Types</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4vL-QLci8w">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Both Java and Python include standard implementations of each of the data structures we have learned about in this course. While it is very useful and interesting from an academic perspective to build our own linked lists and hash tables, in practice we would rarely do so. In this section, we will briefly introduce the standard library versions of each data structure and provide references to where we can find more information about each one and how to use them.</p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>Python includes many useful data structures as built-in data types. We can use them to build just about any structure we need quickly and efficiently. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Python Tutorial</a> has some great information about data structures in Python and how we can use them.</p>
<p>Python includes several data types that are grouped under the heading of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range" rel="external" target="_blank">sequence data types</a>, and they all share many operations in common. We&rsquo;ll look at two of the sequence data types: tuples and lists.</p>
<h3 id="tuples">Tuples</h3>
<p>While we have not directly discussed tuples often, it is important to know that Python natively supports tuples as a basic data type. In Python, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple" rel="external" target="_blank">tuple</a> is simply a combination of a number of values separated by commas. They are commonly placed within parentheses, but it is not required.</p>
<p>We can directly access elements in a tuple using the same notation we use for arrays, and we can even unpack tuples into multiple variables or return them from functions. Tuples are a great way to pass multiple values as a single variable.</p>

<p>Python&rsquo;s default data structure for sequences of data is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list" rel="external" target="_blank">list</a>. In fact, throughout this course, we have been using Python lists as a stand-in for the arrays that are supported by most other languages. Thankfully, lists in Python are much more flexible, since they can be dynamically resized, sliced, and iterated very easily. In terms of performance, a Python list is roughly equivalent to an array in other languages. We can access elements in constant time when the index is known, but inserting and removing from the beginning of the list runs in order of $N$ time since elements must be shifted backwards. This makes them a poor choice for queues and stacks, where elements must be added and removed from both ends of the list.</p>

<p>The Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Collections</a> library contains a special class called a deque (pronounced &ldquo;deck&rdquo;, and short for &ldquo;double ended queue&rdquo;) that is a linked list-style implementation that provides much faster constant time inserts and removals from either end of the container. In Python, it is recommended to use the deque data structure when implementing stacks and queues.</p>
<p>In a deque, the ends are referred to as &ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;left&rdquo;, so there are methods <code>append()</code> and <code>pop()</code> that impact the right side of the container, and <code>appendleft()</code> and <code>popleft()</code> that modify the left side. We can use a combination of those methods to implement both a Stack and a Queue using a deque in Python.</p>

<p>Python also implements a version of the class Map data structure, called a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="external" target="_blank">dictionary</a>. In Python, a dictionary stores key-value pairs, very similarly to how associative arrays work in other languages. Behind the scenes, it uses a hashing function to efficiently store and retrieve elements, making most operations run in near constant time.</p>
<p>The one limitation with Python dictionaries is that only hashable data types can be used as keys. We cannot use a list or a dictionary as the key for a dictionary in Python. Thankfully, strings, numbers, and most objects that implement a <code>__hash__()</code> and <code>__eq__()</code> method can be used.</p>

<p>Python also includes a built in data type to represent a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="external" target="_blank">set</a>. Just like we saw with our analysis, Python also uses a hash-based implementation to allow us to quickly find elements in the set, and therefore does not keep track of any ordering between the elements. We can easily add or remove elements, and Python uniquely allows us to use the binary operators to compute several set operations such as union and intersection.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcCtPamophM">YouTube Video</a>

<p><a href="/cc310/08-perf-string/10-string-builder/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<p>In CC 310 we covered various data structures: stacks, sets, lists, queues, and hash tables. When we looked at these structures, we considered how to access elements within the structures, how we would create our own implementation of the structure, and tasks that these structures would be fitting for as well as ill fitting. Throughout this course we will introduce and implement a variety of data structures as we did in CC 310.</p>
<p>We begin this course with an often overlooked structure: strings. By the end of this chapter, we will understand how strings are data structures, how we access elements, what types of tasks are appropriate for strings, and how we can improve on strings in our code.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>In many data science positions, programmers often work with text-based data. Some examples of text-based data include biology for DNA sequencing, social media for sentiment classification, online libraries for citation networks, and many other types of businesses for data analytics. Currently, strings are often used for word embeddings, which determine how similar or dissimilar words are to one another. An industry leading software for this application is Tensorflow for Python, which generated the image below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-1f062e37152385abdb1e7f994e2bb56f" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Word Embeddings Near &lsquo;Python&rsquo;" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/13/1_word_embedding.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<!--- https://projector.tensorflow.org/ I generated and took this screen shot. --->
<p>In an immense oversimplification, the process used for word embeddings is to read in a large amount of text and then use machine learning algorithms to determine similarity by using the words around each word. This impacts general users like us in search engines, streaming services, dating applications, and much more! For example, if you were to search Python topics in your search results may appear referring to the coding language, the reptile, the comedy troupe, and many more. When we use machine learning to determine word meanings, it is important that the data is first parsed correctly and stored in efficient ways so that we can access elements as needed.

<h2 id="what-are-strings">What are Strings?</h2>
<p>Strings are data structures which store an ordered set of characters. Recall that a character can be a: letter, number, symbol, punctuation mark, or white space. Strings can contain any number and any combination of these. As such, strings can be single characters, words, sentences, and even more.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-work-with-strings">How do we work with Strings?</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s refresh ourselves on how strings work, starting with the example string: <code>s = &quot;Go Cats!&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>As with other data structures, we can access elements within the string itself. Using the example above, <code>s[0]</code> would contain the character &lsquo;G&rsquo;, <code>s[1]</code> would contain the character &lsquo;o&rsquo;, <code>s[2]</code> would contain the character &rsquo; &lsquo;, and so on.</p>
<p>We can determine the size of a string by using length functions; in our example, the length of s would be 8. It is also important to note that when dealing with strings, null is not equivalent to &ldquo;&rdquo;. For string <code>s = &quot;&quot;</code>, the length of s would be 0. However for string <code>s = null</code>, accessing the length of s would return an error that null has no length property.</p>
<p>We can also add to strings or append on a surface level; though it is not that simple behind the scenes. The String class is <strong>immutable</strong>. This means that changes will not happen directly to the string; when appending or inserting, code will create a new string to hold that value. More concisely, the state of an immutable object cannot change.</p>
<p>We cannot assign elements of the string directly and more broadly for any immutable object. For example, if we wanted the string from our example to be &lsquo;Go Cat!!&rsquo;, we cannot assign the element through <code>s[6] = '!'</code>. This would result in an item assignment error.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Try It!</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>For an example, consider string s = &lsquo;abc&rsquo;. If we then state in code s = s + &lsquo;123&rsquo;, this will create a new place in memory for the new definition of s. We can verify this in code by using the id() function.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">string s = &#39;abc&#39;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">id(s)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">Output: 140240213073680 #may be different on your personal device
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">string s = s + &#39;123&#39;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">id(s)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">Output: 140239945470168 </span></span></code></pre></div></div>
</div>
<p>While on the surface it appears that we are working with the same variable, our code will actually refer to a different one. There are many other immutable data types as well as mutable data types.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Mutable vs. Immutable</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>On the topic of immutable, we can also discuss the converse: <strong>mutable</strong> objects. Being a mutable object means that the state of the object can change. In CC310, we often worked with arrays to implement various data structures. Arrays are mutable, so as we add, change, or remove elements from an array, the array changes its state to accommodate the change rather than creating a new location in memory.</p>

<p>Recall that strings are reference variables. As such, string variables hold pointers to values and the value is stored in memory. For the following example, the <code>HEAP</code> refers to what is currently stored in memory and <code>VARIABLE</code> shows the current value of the variable <code>RESULT</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initialization: In line two, we initialize <code>RESULT</code> as an empty string. In the heap, we have the empty string at memory location <code>0x1</code>. Thus, <code>RESULT</code> is holding the pointer <code>0x1</code>.

</li>
<li>
<p>I = 1: Now we have entered the loop and on line 4, we add more characters to our string. At this point, we would have entry <code>0x2</code> in our heap and our variable <code>RESULT</code> would have the pointer <code>0x2</code>. Continuing through the code, line 5 determines if <code>I</code> is divisible by 2. In this iteration <code>I = 1</code>, so we take the else branch. We again add characters to our string, resulting in a new entry in <code>0x3</code> and our variable <code>RESULT</code> containing the pointer <code>0x3</code>. In total, we have written 8 characters. We then increment <code>I</code> and move to the next iteration.

<p>I = 2: We continue the loop and on line 4, we add more characters to our string. At this point, we would have entry <code>0x4</code> in our heap and our variable <code>RESULT</code> would have the pointer <code>0x4</code>. Continuing through the code, line 5 determines if <code>I</code> is divisible by 2. In this iteration <code>I = 2</code>, so we take the if branch. We again add characters to our string, resulting in a new entry in <code>0x5</code> and our variable <code>RESULT</code> containing the pointer <code>0x5</code>. In this iteration, we have written 17 characters. We then increment <code>I</code> and move to the next iteration of the loop.

Continuing through the code, line 5 determines if <code>I</code> is divisible by 2. In this iteration <code>I = 3</code>, so we take the if branch. We again add characters to our string, resulting in a new entry in <code>0x7</code> and our variable <code>RESULT</code> containing the pointer <code>0x7</code>. In this iteration, we have written 26 characters. We then increment <code>I</code> and thus <code>I = 4</code> breaking out of the loop.

<p>You need not worry about creating the equations! Based on this generalization, if the user wanted to do 100K iterations, say for gene sequencing, there would be (2x100,000 - 1) = 200,001 memory entries and (9x100,000<sup>2</sup> + 7x100,000)/2 = 45 billion character copies. This behavior is not exclusive to strings; this will occur for any immutable type.</p>
<p>While this example is contrived, it is not too far off the mark. Another caveat to this analysis is that, depending on our programming language, there will be a periodic &lsquo;memory collection&rsquo;; there wont be 200K memory addresses occupied at one time. Writing to memory in this way can be costly in terms of time, which in industry is money.</p>

<p>As a result of being immutable, strings can be cumbersome to work with in certain applications. When working with long strings or strings that we are continually appending to, such as in the memory example, we end up creating a lot of sizable copies.</p>
<p>Recall from the memory example the block of pseudocode.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">1. function APPENDER(NUMBER, BASE)

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">11. end function</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, what if we changed <code>RESULT</code> to a mutable type, such as a StringBuilder in Java. Once the loop is done, we can cast <code>RESULT</code> to a string. By changing just the one aspect of the code, we would make only one copy of <code>RESULT</code> and have far less character copies.</p>

<p>Again, you need not worry about creating these equations for this course. To illustrate the improvement even more explicitly, let&rsquo;s consider our previous example with 100K iterations. For APPENDER there were (2x100,000 - 1) = 200,001 memory entries and (9x100,000<sup>2</sup> + 7x100,000)/2 = 45 billion character copies. For APPENDER_LIST we now have just 2 memory entries and (9x100,000 - 1) = 899,999 character copies. This dramatic improvement was a result of changing our data structure ever so slightly.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>In this module, we reviewed each of the data structures we have explored in this class. Most importantly, we looked at how they compare in terms of performance and discussed some of the best and most efficient ways to use them in our programs.</p>
<p>Using that information, we introduced the standard collection libraries for both Java and Python, and saw how those professional implementations closely follow the same ideas and analysis that we saw in our own structures. While the professional structures may have many more features and more complex code, at the core they still work just like the structures we learned how to build from scratch.</p>
<p>One of the best traits of a good programmer is knowing how to most effectively use the tools made available to us through the programming languages and libraries we have chosen to use. The goal of this class is to give us the background we need to understand how the various collection data structures we can choose from work, so that we can use them in the most effective way to build useful and efficient programs.</p>

<p>To start this course, we have looked into strings. They are a very natural way to represent data, especially in real world applications. Often though, the datapoints can be very large and require multiple modifications. We also examined how strings work: element access, retrieving the size, and modifying them. We looked into some alternatives which included StringBuilders for Java and character arrays for Python.</p>
<p>To really understand this point, we have included a comparison. We have implemented the APPENDER and APPENDER_LIST functions in both Python and Java. For the Java implementation, we utilized StringBuilders.</p>

<p>These figures compare Strings and lists for Python and Strings and StringBuilders for Java. The intention of these is not to compare Python and Java.</p>
<p>In both languages, we see that the string function and the respective alternative performed comparably until approximately 10<sup>6</sup> (1,000,000 characters). Again, these are somewhat contrived examples with the intention of understanding side effects of using strings.</p>
<p>As we have discussed, modern coding languages will have clean up protocols and memory management strategies. With the intention of this class in mind, we will not discuss the memory analysis in practice.</p>
<p>When modifying strings we need to be cognizant of how often we will be making changes and how large those changes will be. If we are just accessing particular elements or only doing a few modifications then using plain strings is a reasonable solution. However, if we are looking to build our own DNA sequence this is not a good way to go as strings are immutable.</p>

<p><a href="/cc310/09-trees/01-tree-intro/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<p>For the next data structure in the course, we will cover trees, which are used to show hierarchical data. Trees can have many shapes and sizes and there is a wide variety of data that can be organized using them. Real world data that is appropriate for trees can include: family trees, management structures, file systems, biological classifications, anatomical structures and much more.</p>
<hr>
<p>We can look at an example of a tree and the relationships they can show. Consider this file tree; it has folders and files in folders.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-254ff67812e0f8688da2b54938ea7fa2" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="File Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2FileTree.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-254ff67812e0f8688da2b54938ea7fa2"><img alt="File Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2FileTree.png"></a></p>
<p>If we wanted to access the file <code>elm.txt</code>, we would have to follow this file path: <code>Foo/B/Q/E/elm.txt</code>. We can similarly store the file structure as a tree like we below. As before, if we wanted to get to the file <code>elm.txt</code> we would navigate the tree in the order: <code>Foo -&gt; B -&gt; Q -&gt; E -&gt; elm.txt</code>. As mentioned before, trees can be used on very diverse data sets; they are not limited to file trees!</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-c82f8ab522974c5fca3b6f34fea002da" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="File Tree as Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_FileTree.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<h2 id="what-are-trees">What are trees?</h2>
<p>In the last module we talked about strings which are a linear data structure. To be explicit, this means that the elements in a string form a line of characters. A tree, by contrast, is a <strong>hierarchal structure</strong> which is utilized best in multidimensional data. Going back to our file tree example, folders are not limited to just one file, there can be multiple files contained in a single folder- thus making it multidimensional.</p>
<p>Consider the string &ldquo;abc123&rdquo;; this is a linear piece of data where there is exactly one character after another. We can use trees to show linear data as well.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-fc2df5cd8f60572e2f9593efc96c8bc6" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="String as Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_String.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-fc2df5cd8f60572e2f9593efc96c8bc6"><img alt="String as Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_String.png"></a></p>
<p>While trees <em>can</em> be used for linear data, it would be excessive and inefficient to implement them for single strings. In an upcoming module, we will see how we can use trees to represent any number of strings! For example, this tree below contains 7 words: &lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;an&rsquo;, &lsquo;and&rsquo;, &lsquo;ant&rsquo;, &lsquo;any&rsquo;, &lsquo;all&rsquo;, and &lsquo;alp&rsquo;.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-e94598a02222bd5f0c5bfc94a289347c" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Small Words" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_SmallWords.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>In the next sections, we will discuss the properties of a tree data structure and how we would design one ourselves. Once we have a good understanding of trees and the properties of trees, we will implement our own.</p>

<p>The video incorrectly states the degree of a tree is equal to the degree of the root. The correct definition is that the degree of a tree is the <strong>largest</strong> degree of any node in the tree.</p>

<p><a href="/cc310/09-trees/02-general-terms/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<p>To get ourselves comfortable in working with trees, we will outline some standard vocabulary. Throughout this section, we will use the following tree as a guiding example for visualizing the definitions.<br>
<a href="#R-image-49a764a3f5ba65293ea90499b101d3eb" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Blank" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_Blank.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>Node</code> - the general term for a structure which contains an item, such as a character or even another data structure.</li>
<li><code>Edge</code> - the connection between two nodes. In a tree, the edge will be pointing in a downward direction.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#R-image-1d4786b7e4702bf26e26dc64ab260efd" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Nodes and Edges" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_NodeEdge.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-1d4786b7e4702bf26e26dc64ab260efd"><img alt="Nodes and Edges" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_NodeEdge.png"></a></p>
<p>This tree has five edges and six nodes. There is no limit to the number of nodes in a tree. The only stipulation is that the tree is <code>fully connected</code>. This means that there cannot be disjoint portions of the tree. We will look at examples in the next section.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>A rule of thumb for discerning trees is this: if you imagine holding the tree up by the root and gravity took effect, then all edges must be pointing downward. If an edge is pointing upward, we will have a <code>cycle</code> within our structure so it will not be a tree.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><code>Root</code> - the topmost node of the tree</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#R-image-ac81e8174399a3ab54e662ad41ebaae9" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Root" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_Root.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>To be a tree, there must be exactly one root. Having multiple roots, will result in a <code>cycle</code> or a tree that is not <code>fully connected</code>. In short, a <code>cycle</code> is a loop in the tree.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><code>Parent</code> - a node with an edge that connects to another node further from the root. We can also define the root of a tree with respect to this definition; <code>Root</code>: a node with no parent.</li>
<li><code>Child</code> - a node with an edge that connects to another node closer to the root.
<ul>
<li>In a general tree, the children of a node are an unordered set. There is not a fixed or defined order for generic trees.

In a tree, child nodes must have exactly one parent node. If a child node has more than one parent, then a <code>cycle</code> will occur. If there is a node without a parent node, then this is necessarily the root node. There is no limit to the number of child nodes a parent node can have, but to be a parent node, the node must have at least one child node.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><code>Leaf</code> - a node with no children.

This tree has four leaves. There is no limit to how many leaves can be in a tree.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><code>Degree</code>
<ul>
<li><code>Degree of a node</code> - the number of children a node has. The degree of a leaf is zero.</li>
<li><code>Degree of a tree</code> - the degree of an entire tree is the <strong>largest</strong> degree of any node found in the tree.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The degree of the nodes are shown as the values on the nodes in this example. The degree of the tree is the largest degree of any node in the tree. Thus, the degree for this tree is 3.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>A <code>tree</code> is defined recursively. This means that each child of the root is the root of another tree and the children of those are roots to trees as well. Again, this is a recursive definition so it will continue to the leaves. The leaves are also trees with just a single node as the root.<br>

In our example tree, we have six trees. Each tree is outlined in a red dashed circle:

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="invalid-trees">Invalid Trees</h2>
<p>Below are some examples of invalid trees.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A cycle
<a href="#R-image-91e03c25c87608b35b3b49ca02324dd7" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Cycle" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_Cycle.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-91e03c25c87608b35b3b49ca02324dd7"><img alt="Cycle" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_Cycle.png"></a>
Again, cycles are essentially loops that occur in our tree. In this example, we see that our leaf has two parents. One way to determine whether your data structure has a cycle is if there is more than one way to get from the root to any node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cycle
<a href="#R-image-2ff490aa50e34cc0cba48efa8d26cd2b" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Cycle" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_Cycle2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-2ff490aa50e34cc0cba48efa8d26cd2b"><img alt="Cycle" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_Cycle2.png"></a>
Here we can see another cycle. In this case, the node immediately after the root has two parents, which is a clue that a cycle exists. Another test</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two Roots
<a href="#R-image-5aad213669a69298312215499278b2d2" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Two Roots" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_TwoRoots.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-5aad213669a69298312215499278b2d2"><img alt="Two Roots" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_TwoRoots.png"></a>
Trees must have a single root. In this instance, it may look like we have a tree with two roots. Working through this, we also see that the node in the center has two parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two Trees
<a href="#R-image-12f97bc7c6ce86fd1d2bc4386a6ba7f7" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Double Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_DoubleTree.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-12f97bc7c6ce86fd1d2bc4386a6ba7f7"><img alt="Double Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_DoubleTree.png"></a>
This example would be considered two trees, not a tree with two parts. In this figure, we have two fully connected components. Since they are not connected to each other, this is not a single tree.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y02_6lWMVnQ">YouTube Video</a>

<p><a href="/cc310/09-trees/04-tree-operations/video/">Video Materials</a></p>
<p>Along with understanding how trees work, we want to also be able to implement a tree of our own. We will now outline key components of a tree class.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="mytree">MyTree</h3>
<p>Recall that trees are defined recursively so we can build them from the leaves up where each leaf is a tree itself. Each tree will have three properties: the item it contains as an object, its parent node of type MyTree, and its children as a list of MyTrees. Upon instantiation of a new MyTree, we will set the item value and initialize the parent node to None and the children to an empty list of type MyTree.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-1383717ed563cfc4ca30fa6fe49eae95" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="UML" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/tree_uml.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-1383717ed563cfc4ca30fa6fe49eae95"><img alt="UML" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/tree_uml.png"></a></p>
<p>Suppose that we wanted to construct the following tree.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-f18b30cf6e184a961e9a5965f21e3ffa" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_Implementation.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-f18b30cf6e184a961e9a5965f21e3ffa"><img alt="Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_Implementation.png"></a></p>
<p>We would start by initializing each node as a tree with no parent, no children, and the item in this instance would be the characters. Then we build it up level by level by add the appropriate children to the respective parent.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This implementation will not prevent all cycles. In the next module, we will introduce steps to prevent cycles and maintain true tree structures.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="finding-a-child">Finding a child</h3>
<p>In this method, we will take a value as input and then check if that value is the item of a child of the current node. If the value is not the item for any of the node&rsquo;s children then we should return none.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function FINDCHILD(VALUE)

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    return NONE
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><hr>
<h3 id="getting--children-item-parent-or-degree">Getting  children, item, parent, or degree</h3>
<p>Each of these will be rather straight forward; children, item, and parent are all attributes of our node, so we can have a getter function that returns the respective values. The slightly more involved task will be getting the degree. Recall that the degree of a node is equal to the number of children. Thus, we can simply count the number of children and return this number for the degree.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="checking-node-type">Checking node type</h3>
<p>We will have two functions to check the node type: one to determine if the node is a leaf and one to determine if it is a root. The definition of a leaf is a node that has no children. Thus, to check if a node is a leaf, we can simply check if the number of children is equal to zero. Similarly, since the definition of a root is a node with no parent, we can check that the parent attribute of the node is None.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="adding-a-child">Adding a child</h3>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5gy1Q7hx1w">YouTube Video</a>

<p>When we wish to add a child, we must fisrt make sure we are able to add the child.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check that the child is an instance of <code>MyTree</code></li>
<li>Make sure the child doesn&rsquo;t already have a parent</li>
<li>Make sure the child isn&rsquo;t already a child of the parent</li>
</ol>
<p>We will return true if the child was successfully added and false otherwise while raising the appropriate errors.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function ADDCHILD(CHILD)

<ol>
<li>Instantiate MyTree <code>a</code> with item &lsquo;A&rsquo;</li>
<li>Instantiate MyTree <code>b</code> with item &lsquo;B&rsquo;</li>
<li>Instantiate MyTree <code>c</code> with item &lsquo;C&rsquo;</li>
<li>Instantiate MyTree <code>d</code> with item &lsquo;D&rsquo;</li>
<li>Instantiate MyTree <code>e</code> with item &lsquo;E&rsquo;</li>
<li>Instantiate MyTree <code>f</code> with item &lsquo;F&rsquo;</li>
<li>Instantiate MyTree <code>g</code> with item &lsquo;G&rsquo;</li>
<li>Instantiate MyTree <code>h</code> with item &lsquo;H&rsquo;</li>
<li>Instantiate MyTree <code>i</code> with item &lsquo;I&rsquo;</li>
<li>Add child tree <code>g</code> to tree <code>d</code></li>
<li>Add child tree <code>h</code> to tree <code>d</code></li>
<li>Add child tree <code>i</code> to tree <code>d</code></li>
<li>Add child tree <code>e</code> to tree <code>b</code></li>
<li>Add child tree <code>f</code> to tree <code>b</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Once we have completed that, visually, we would have the tree above and in code we would have:</p>
<ul>
<li>MyTree <code>a</code> with parent_node = None, item = &lsquo;A&rsquo;, children = {<code>b</code>,<code>c</code>,<code>d</code>}</li>
<li>MyTree <code>b</code> with parent_node = <code>a</code>, item = &lsquo;B&rsquo;, children = {<code>e</code>,<code>f</code>}</li>
<li>MyTree <code>c</code> with parent_node = <code>a</code>, item = &lsquo;C&rsquo;, children = { }</li>
<li>MyTree <code>d</code> with parent_node = <code>a</code>, item = &lsquo;D&rsquo;, children = {<code>g</code>,<code>h</code>,<code>i</code>}</li>
<li>MyTree <code>e</code> with parent_node = <code>b</code>, item = &lsquo;E&rsquo;, children = { }</li>
<li>MyTree <code>f</code> with parent_node = <code>b</code>, item = &lsquo;F&rsquo;, children = { }</li>
<li>MyTree <code>g</code> with parent_node = <code>d</code>, item = &lsquo;G&rsquo;, children = { }</li>
<li>MyTree <code>h</code> with parent_node = <code>d</code>, item = &lsquo;H&rsquo;, children = { }</li>
<li>MyTree <code>i</code> with parent_node = <code>d</code>, item = &lsquo;I&rsquo;, children = { }</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When adding a child we must currently be at the node we want to be the parent. Much like when you want to add a file to a folder, you must specify exactly where you want it. If you don&rsquo;t, this could result in a wayward child.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="removing-a-child">Removing a child</h3>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtfZIUMPrJY">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In the case of removing a child, we first need to check that the child we are attempting to remove is an instance of <code>MyTree</code>. We will return true if we successfully remove the child and false otherwise.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function REMOVECHILD(CHILD)

When removing a child, we are not &rsquo;erasing&rsquo; it, we are just cutting the tie from parent to child and child to parent. Consider removing <code>d</code> from <code>a</code>. Visually, we would have two disjoint trees, shown below:</p>

<p>Many of the terms used in trees relate to terms used in family trees. Having this in mind can help us to better understand some of the terminology involved with abstract trees. Here we have a sample family tree.
<a href="#R-image-e412cde0f652e35750af3211d8e21180" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Family Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/3Tree_FamilyTree.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<ul>
<li><code>Ancestor</code> - The ancestors of a node are those reached from child to parent relationships. We can think of this as our parents and our parent&rsquo;s parents, and so on.
<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s look at all of the ancestors of each of our nodes in the family tree.
<ul>
<li>Ava&rsquo;s ancestors: <u>Uzzi, Joe, Myra</u>. This is because, <strong>Uzzi</strong> is the parent of Ava, <strong>Joe</strong> is the parent of Uzzi, and <strong>Myra</strong> is the parent of Joe. Try to work out the following and click the name to reveal the ancestors.

<p>We can describe the sizes of trees and position of nodes using different terminology, like level, depth, and height.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-bcd181815c3227533001c0651f01914d" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Family Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/3Tree_FamilyTree.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<ul>
<li><code>Level</code> - The level of a node characterizes the distance between the node and the root. The root of the tree is considered level 1. As you move away from the tree, the level increases by one.
<ul>
<li>For our family tree example, what nodes are in the following levels? Think about the answer and then click corresponding arrow.

<p>When we talk about traversals for general trees we have used the phrase &rsquo;the traversal <em>could</em> result in&rsquo;. We would like to expand on why &lsquo;could&rsquo; is used here. Each of these general trees are the same but their traversals could be different. The key concept in this is that for a general tree, the children are an unordered set of nodes; they do not have a defined or fixed order. The relationships that are fixed are the parent/child relationships.

<p>A binary tree is a type of tree with some special conditions. First, it must follow the guidelines of being a tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>There must be single root,</li>
<li>each child node must have a single parent node,</li>
<li>it must be fully connected (no disjoint parts), and</li>
<li>there can be no cycles (no loops).</li>
</ul>
<p>The special conditions that we impose on binary trees are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each node has at most 2 children (nodes can have 0, 1, or 2 children), and</li>
<li>unlike general trees, the children in a binary tree are not an unordered set. The children must be ordered such that:
<ul>
<li>all of the descendants in the left tree are less than the parent&rsquo;s value, and</li>
<li>all of the descendants in the right tree are greater than the parent&rsquo;s value</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To reinforce these concepts, we will look at examples of binary trees and examples that are not binary trees.</p>

<h2 id="valid-binary-trees">Valid Binary Trees</h2>
<p><a href="#R-image-cdb937a7d7fed2e0654506936eda6c88" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Single Node" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/4Binary_Single.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-cdb937a7d7fed2e0654506936eda6c88"><img alt="Single Node" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/4Binary_Single.png"></a></p>
<p>This is a valid binary tree. We have a single node, the root, with no children. As with general trees, binary trees are built recursively. Thus, each node and its child(ren) are trees themselves.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-8984e455fce51cf7958a4dcec785baf4" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Unbalanced" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/4Binary_UnBal.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>This is also a valid binary tree. All of the left children are less than their parent. The node with item &lsquo;10&rsquo; is also in the correct position as it is less than 12, 13, and 14 but greater than 9.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-4d244de3770add55d9ebfa4d02f8d75d" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Balanced" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/4Binary_Bal.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>We have the same nodes but our root is now 12 whereas before it was 14. This is also a valid binary tree.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-78279130b3e996cbb7f347e6728766a0" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Alphabet Binary Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/4Binary_Alpha.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Here we have an example of a binary tree with alphabetical items. As long as we have items which have a predefined order, we can organize them using a binary tree.</p>
<h2 id="invalid-binary-trees">Invalid Binary Trees</h2>
<p><a href="#R-image-4684f1fcad08dd17705b424eed1717e7" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Alphabet Non-Binary Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/4Binary_NOTAlpha.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>We may be inclined to say that this is a binary tree: each node has 0, 1, or 2 children and amongst children and parent nodes, the left child is smaller than the parent and the right child is greater than the parent. However, in binary trees, all of the nodes in the left tree must be smaller than the root and all of the nodes in the right tree must be larger than the root. In this tree, <code>D</code> is out of place. Node <code>D</code> is less than node <code>T</code> but it is also less than node <code>Q</code>. Thus, node <code>D</code> must be on the right of node <code>Q</code>.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-bbee6faf7237769def02032b12b05a36" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Too Many Children" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/4Binary_ManyChildren.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>In this case, we do not have a binary tree. This does fit all of the criteria for being a tree but not the criteria for a binary tree. Nodes in binary trees can have at most 2 children. Node <code>30</code> has three children.</p>

<h1 id="binary-tree-traversals">Binary Tree Traversals</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNkWt307y84">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In the first module we discussed two types of traversals: preorder and postorder. Within that discussion, we noted that for general trees, the preorder and postorder traversal may not be unique. This was due to the fact that children nodes are an unordered set.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>We are now working with binary trees which have a defined child order. As a result, the preorder and postorder traversals will be <strong>unique</strong>! These means that for a binary tree when we do a preorder traversal there is exactly one string that is possible. The same applies for postorder traversals as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Recall that these were defined as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preorder Traversal (Remember: Root Children):
<ol>
<li>Access the root</li>
<li>Run the preorder traversal on the children</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Postorder Traversal (Remember: Children Root):
<ol>
<li>Run the postorder traversal on the children</li>
<li>Access the root.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now for binary trees, we can modify their definitions to be more explicit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preorder Traversal (Remember: Root Left Right):
<ol>
<li>Access the root</li>
<li>Run the preorder traversal on the left child</li>
<li>Run the preorder traversal on the right child</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Postorder Traversal (Remember: Left Right Root):
<ol>
<li>Run the postorder traversal on the left child</li>
<li>Run the postorder traversal on the right child</li>
<li>Access the root.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s practice traversals on the following binary tree.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyM6L6xqn_8">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Since we have fixed order on the children, we can introduce another type of traversal: in-order traversal.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In-order Traversal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the in-order traversal on the left child</li>
<li>Access the root, write its value</li>

<p>While this is a valid binary tree, it is not balanced. Let&rsquo;s look at the following tree.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-998050a1100b82cfb8f7d38a6725dd07" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Balanced" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/4Binary_Bal.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>We have the same nodes but our root is now 12 whereas before it was 14. This is a valid binary tree. We call this a <code>balanced</code> binary tree. A balanced binary tree looks visually even amongst the left and right trees in terms of number of nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Balancing is not necessary for a valid binary tree. It is, however, important in terms of time efficiency to have a balanced tree. For example, the number of actions when inserting an element is about the same as the number of levels in the tree. If we tried to add the value 11 into the unbalanced tree, we would traverse 5 nodes. If we tried to add the value 11 in to the balanced tree, we would traverse just 3 nodes.</p>
<p>We believe that balancing binary trees is out of the scope of this course. If you are interested in how we might balance a tree, feel free to check out these videos by Dr. Joshua Weese.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>In this module we have introduce vocabulary related to trees and what makes a tree a tree. To recap, we have introduced the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Child</code> - a node with an edge that connects to another node closer to the root.</li>
<li><code>Degree</code>
<ul>
<li><code>Degree of a node</code> - the number of children a node has. The degree of a leaf is zero.</li>
<li><code>Degree of a tree</code> - the degree of an entire tree is the <strong>largest</strong> degree of any node found in the tree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Edge</code> - connection between two nodes. In a tree, the edge will be pointing in a downward direction.</li>
<li><code>Leaf</code> - a node with no children.</li>
<li><code>Node</code> - the general term for a structure which contains an item, such as a character or even another data structure.</li>
<li><code>Parent</code> - a node with an edge that connects to another node further from the root. We can also define the root of a tree with respect to this definition;</li>
<li><code>Root</code> - the topmost node of the tree; a node with no parent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we will work on creating our own implementation of a tree. These definitions will serve as a resource to us when we need refreshing on meanings; feel free to refer back to them as needed.</p>
<p>We discussed more terminology related to trees as well as tree traversals. To recap the new vocabulary:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Ancestor</code> - The ancestors of a node are those reached from child to parent relationships. We can think of this as our parents and the parents of our parents, and so on.</li>
<li><code>Depth</code> - The depth of a node is its distance to the root. Thus, the root has depth zero. <code>Level</code> and <code>depth</code> are related in that: <code>level = 1 + depth</code>.</li>
<li><code>Descendant</code> - The descendants of a node are those reached from parent to child relationships. We can think of this as our children and our children&rsquo;s children and so on.</li>
<li><code>Height of a Node</code> - The height of a node is the <strong>longest</strong> path to a leaf descendant. The height of a leaf is zero.</li>
<li><code>Height of a Tree</code> - The height of a tree is equal to the height of the root.</li>
<li><code>Level</code> - The level of a node characterizes the distance the node is from the root. The root of the tree is considered level 1. As you move away from the tree, the level increases by one.</li>
<li><code>Path</code> - a sequence of nodes and edges which connect a node with its descendant.</li>
<li><code>Siblings</code> - Nodes which share the same parent</li>
<li><code>Traversal</code> is a general term we use to describe going through a tree. The following traversals are defined recursively.
<ul>
<li>Preorder Traversal (Remember: Root Children or Root Left Right):
<ol>
<li>Access the root</li>
<li>Run the preorder traversal on the children</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Postorder Traversal (Remember: Children Root or Left Right Root):
<ol>
<li>Run the postorder traversal on the children</li>
<li>Access the root.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Inorder Traversal on Binary Trees (Remember: Left Root Right)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The next data structure we will introduce is a graph.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-d6333399fb0bdfaec2c6b1be46e57e16" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Graph Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphex1.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Graphs are multidimensional data structures that can represent many different types of data. We can use graphs to represent electronic circuits and wiring, transportation routes, and networks such as the Internet or social groups.</p>
<p>A popular and fun use of graphs is to build connections between people such as Facebook friends or even connections between performers. One example is the parlor game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon" rel="external" target="_blank">Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</a>. Players attempt to connect Kevin Bacon to other performers through movie roles in six people or less.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-745571d3995d2d6babf28d47131b9e8b" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/actors.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>For example, Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Bacon are directly connected via &lsquo;Mystic River&rsquo;. Keanu Reeves and Kevin Bacon have never performed in the same film, but Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne are connected via &lsquo;The Matrix&rsquo;. Thus, Keanu and Kevin are connected via Laurence.</p>
<p>In this module we will discuss graphs in more detail and build our own implementation of graphs.</p>

<p>We will discuss some of the basic terminology associated with graphs. Some of this vocabulary should feel familiar from the trees section; trees are a specific type of graph!</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Nodes</code>: Node is the general term for a structure which contains an item.
<ul>
<li><code>Size</code>: The size of a graph is the number of nodes.</li>
<li><code>Capacity</code>: The capacity of a graph is the maximum number of nodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p><strong>Nodes</strong> can be, but are not limited to the following examples:
- physical locations (IE Manhattan, Topeka, Salina),
- computer components (IE CPU, GPU, RAM), or
- people (IE Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Emma Stone)</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><code>Edges</code>: Edges are the connection between two nodes. Depending on the data, edges can represent physical distance, films, cost, and much more.
<ul>
<li><code>Adjacent</code>: Node A and node B are said to be adjacent if there is an edge from node A to node B.</li>
<li><code>Neighbors</code>: The neighbors of a node are nodes which are adjacent to the node.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p><strong>Edges</strong> can be, but are not limited to:
- physical distances, like the distance between cities or wiring between computer components,
- cost, like bus fares, and
- films, like the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon example</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><code>Cycles</code>: A cycle is a path where the first and last node are the only repeated nodes. More explicitly, this means that we start at node A and are able to end up back at node A.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>For example, we can translate the <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/Maps/Amtrak-System-Map-1018.pdf" rel="external" target="_blank">Amtrak Train Station Connections</a> into a graph where the edges represent direct train station connections.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-5f9d4ca403954b3bb4d480330fe582a2" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Amtrak Train Graph" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/amtrak.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Within this context, we could say that Little Rock and Fort Worth are <code>adjacent</code>. The <code>neighbors</code> of San Antonio are Fort Worth, Los Angeles, and New Orleans. The Amtrak Train Graph has multiple <code>cycles</code>. One of these is <code>Kansas City -&gt; St. Louis -&gt; Chicago -&gt; Kansas City</code>.</p>

<h1 id="graph-features">Graph Features</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_mNd-CIFpc">YouTube Video</a>

<p>While trees are a type of graph, graphs can have more functionality than trees. For example, recall that to be a single tree, there could be no disconnected pieces.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Connectedness</code>: Graphs do not require being fully connected. There can be disconnected portions within a graph. For example, the following graph shows all of the students in a sophomore biology class. There is an edge between two student nodes if they are Facebook friends.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#R-image-9d4f9f98ddd8375e1bf40ea6131598ce" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Friends Group" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/friends.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Graphs can also have loops. In a tree, this would be like a node being its own parent, which is not an allowable condition.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Loops</code>: Loops are edges which connect a node to itself. These can be useful in depicting graphs that show control flow in programming. In this example, node A is connected to node B and node A is connected to itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#R-image-6c9eb182bf4872da9bd7d244fa5956d9" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="With a Loop" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/loop2.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<h1 id="weighted-graphs">Weighted Graphs</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4_myCOtFnk">YouTube Video</a>

<p>A <strong>weighted</strong> graph is a graph which has weights associated with the edges. These weights quantify the relationships, so they can represent dollars, minutes, miles, and many other factors which our data may depend upon.</p>
<p>Weights are not limited to physical quantities; they can also be our own defined similarity in text, product types, and anything for which we can create a similarity measure for. Let&rsquo;s look at concrete weights using the Amtrak example.</p>
<p>We are able to expand the Amtrak graph from the previous page to include approximate distances in miles between cities.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-99b9f951a20517e9fb9b1e9abfeb0870" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Amtrak Train Graph with Weights" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/amtrak_dist.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-99b9f951a20517e9fb9b1e9abfeb0870"><img alt="Amtrak Train Graph with Weights" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/amtrak_dist.svg"></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Now that we have weights defined on our edges, we can compare paths in a different way. When we discussed trees, we just looked at the number of edges it took to get to another node. We can also determine the shortest path between nodes with respect to distance. If we wanted to travel from San Antonio to Kansas City, we may be tempted to travel <code>San Antonio -&gt; Los Angeles -&gt; Albuquerque -&gt; Kansas City</code> as it has the fewest stops. This trip would take us 2,531 miles (1201+640+690). With the edge weights in mind, a much better route would be <code>San Antonio -&gt; Fort Worth -&gt; Little Rock -&gt; St. Louis -&gt; Kansas City</code> with a total of 1,089 miles(238+320+293+238) traveled.</p>

<h1 id="directed-graphs">Directed Graphs</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7qyV9XOwzA">YouTube Video</a>

<p>A <strong>directed</strong> graph is a graph that has a direction associated with each edge. For example, trees are a directed graph. The edge orientation will imply a fixed direction that we can move about nodes. As with trees, the flat end of the arrow will represent the origin and the arrowhead will represent the destination. If an edge has no arrowheads, then it is assumed that we can traverse both directions.</p>
<p>In the following graph, we have an example distribution network where each store ends up with 5 units in its possession. For example, nine units go from the distribution center to Store A. The distribution center will never receive product from stores as it has no incoming edges.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-4510ab85b75f4b23cf7b39757c3cd053" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Sample Distribution Network" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/distribution-3.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-4510ab85b75f4b23cf7b39757c3cd053"><img alt="Sample Distribution Network" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/distribution-3.svg"></a></p>
<p>Unlike trees, directed graphs can have nodes with multiple incoming edges. We can see an example of this at Store B. The distribution center and Store A both send units to Store B.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">

  <div class="box-content">

<p>In directed graphs, we must be cautious on how we define <strong>adjacent</strong>. For the following, we would say that the source is adjacent to the target. However, the target is not adjacent to the source.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-c8cf8229734f8eba31a6229eac10a17e" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Source and Target Example" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/src_tar_ex.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Formally, node A and node B are said to be adjacent if there is an edge from node A to node B.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When discussing directed graphs, we must also talk about undirected graphs. An <strong>undirected</strong> graph is a graph in which none of the edges have an orientation. If there is at least one directed edge, then it is considered a directed graph.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Undirected Edge</code>: An undirected edge is an edge which has no defined orientation (IE no arrowheads) which implies that we can traverse in either direction. If node A and node B are connected via an undirected edge then we say node A is adjacent to node B and node B is adjacent to node A.</li>

<h1 id="example">Example</h1>

<p>In the following graph, we have an example of a weighted and directed map. This map represents a zoo train where each node represents a station and each edge is a part of the track. Zoo guests can get on and off wherever they desire.</p>
<p>This graph is weighted as guests must pay the associated fee for each part of the track. Our example train also has a one way direction in most cases. The exception to this is the entrance/exit to the aquarium, this part of the track can go either direction.</p>
<p>In this graph, we also have a couple of loops. This would allow for zoo-guests to ride the train around an expansive exhibit such as the elephants or giraffes.</p>
<p>One possible way to tour the zoo for a guest starting at the entrance could be: aquarium, primates, big cats, antelope, giraffes, loop around the giraffes, elephants, aquarium, then exit. Their total payment for just the train would be $14.</p>

<h1 id="matrix-representation">Matrix Representation</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwd8YkQwoqM">YouTube Video</a>

<p>The first way that we can represent graphs is as matrices. In a matrix representation of a graph, we will have an array with all the nodes and a matrix to depict the edges. The matrix that depicts the edges is called the <code>adjacency matrix</code>.</p>
<p>To build the <code>adjacency matrix</code>, we go through the nodes and edges. If there is an edge with weight <code>w</code> going from <code>i</code> to <code>j</code>, then we put <code>w</code> in the <code>(i,j)</code> spot in our <code>adjacency matrix</code>. If there is no edge from <code>i</code> to <code>j</code> then we put infinity in the spot <code>(i,j)</code>. Let&rsquo;s look at some examples.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>An edge that starts at <code>source</code> and ends at <code>target</code> will result in an entry at <code>(source,target)</code> in the adjacency matrix.</p>

<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-5b923f870196236848345f84f67801ba"><img alt="Matrix Representation Example" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphA.svg"></a></p>
<p>Across the top of the following, we have the array of nodes. This give us the index at which each node is located. For example, node A is in spot <code>1</code>, node B is in spot <code>2</code>, node C is in spot <code>3</code> and so on.</p>
<p>Below that we have the adjacency matrix. For the directed edge with weight 2 that goes from node B to node C, we have the value 2 at (2,3) in the adjacency matrix as B has index 2 and C has index 3. For the directed edge with weight 4 that goes from node A to node F, we have the value 4 at (1,6) in the adjacency matrix as A has index 1 and F has index 6.</p>
<p>Since there is no edge that connects from node A to node B, we have infinity in <code>(1,2)</code>.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-334dd6404a425faf163a77432e5d011c" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Matrix" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/matrixA.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<h2 id="example-2">Example 2</h2>
<p>Now suppose we have this graph. We now have some loops present.
<a href="#R-image-cb3142656eaa1c2f705066f5e62ffcdf" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Matrix Representation Example 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphB.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>For example, we have a loop on node E with weight 12 so we will put the value 12 in spot (5,5) as E has index 5.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-5fd790162d6b213419e9b5e54e67d128" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Matrix 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/matrixB.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-5fd790162d6b213419e9b5e54e67d128"><img alt="Matrix 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/matrixB.svg"></a></p>
<h2 id="example-3">Example 3</h2>
<p>Now suppose we have this graph which is undirected and unweighted.
<a href="#R-image-93866799edc9bb4c496e0c5c22c8cd52" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Matrix Representation Example 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphC.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-93866799edc9bb4c496e0c5c22c8cd52"><img alt="Matrix Representation Example 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphC.svg"></a></p>
<p>Since this graph is unweighted, we will treat all edges as though they have weight equal to one. Since this graph is undirected, each edge will essentially show up twice.</p>
<p>For example, for the edge that connects nodes A and B, we will have an entry in our adjacency matrix at <code>(1,2)</code> and <code>(2,1)</code>.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-277fe4e062b52f742f57a88c105681e0" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Matrix 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/matrixC.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgN_qmbtK_M">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In the previous module, we introduced graphs and a matrix-based implementation. For this module, we will continue working with graphs and change our implementation to lists.</p>
<h2 id="why-another-implementation">Why Another Implementation?</h2>
<p>When using graphs, a lot of situational variation can occur. Some graphs can have a few nodes with many edges, many nodes with few edges, and so on. When we use the matrix implementation, we initialize a matrix with the number of columns and rows equal to the number of nodes. For example, if we have a graph with 20 nodes, our adjacency matrix would have 20 rows and 20 columns, resulting in 400 potential entries.</p>
<p>First let&rsquo;s look at the implementation and then we will discuss when one may be better than the other.</p>

<h1 id="list-representation">List Representation</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJqStsuqf_U">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In the matrix representation, we had an array of the node items. In the list representation, we will have an array of node objects. Each <strong>node object</strong> will keep track of the node item, the node index, and the outgoing edges.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-15751f1bdbd3c7fa54897408fa79715b" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Set Up" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/list_graph_setup.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-15751f1bdbd3c7fa54897408fa79715b"><img alt="Set Up" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/list_graph_setup.svg"></a></p>
<p>The <code>item</code> can be any object and the <code>index</code> will be a value within our capacity. The <code>edges</code> will be a list of pairs where the first entry is the index of the target node and the second entry is the weight of the edge.</p>
<p>Since each node will track its neighbors, it is important that we are consistent in our indexing of nodes. If our nodes were to get out of order, then our edges would as well.</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example 1</h2>
<p>Consider the following graph which we saw in the matrix representation.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-7889f512664ac0065ca136b2b6720e91" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphA.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-7889f512664ac0065ca136b2b6720e91"><img alt="Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphA.svg"></a></p>
<p>The following list of nodes depicts the graph above. We can see that each node object has the item and index.</p>
<p>If we look closer at the <code>edges</code> of the node with item <code>A</code> and index <code>1</code>, we see that the set of edges is equal to <code>[(4, 3.0), (6, 4.0)]</code>. This corresponds to the fact that there are two edges with the source as node <code>1</code>. The first ordered pair, <code>(4, 3.0)</code>, means that there is an edge with source node <code>1</code> (<code>A</code>) and target node <code>4</code> (<code>D</code>) that has weight <code>3</code>. We can confirm that in our graph we do have an edge from <code>A</code> to <code>D</code> with weight <code>3</code>.</p>

<h2 id="example-2">Example 2</h2>
<p>The following includes a couple of examples of loops within our graph.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-388cebfaea6981ad85438207eaf590da" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Example 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphB.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>We have loops on nodes <code>D</code>, <code>E</code>, and <code>F</code> in our graph. Recall that a loop is an edge where the source and target are the same. For example, we have an edge with source <code>D</code> and target <code>D</code> that has weight <code>12</code>. We see this in our list representation in the node object with item <code>D</code> and index <code>4</code>, where we have the entry <code>(4,12.0)</code> in the edges.</p>

<h1 id="dense-vs-sparse">Dense VS Sparse</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4bCalShe_Y">YouTube Video</a>

<p>When considering which implementation to use, we need to consider the connectivity in our graph. The terms that we use to describe the connectedness are <strong>dense</strong> and <strong>sparse</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Dense Graph</code>: A dense graph is a graph in which there is a large number of edges. Typically in a dense graph, the number of edges is close to the maximum number of edges.</li>
<li><code>Sparse Graph</code>: A sparse graph is a graph in which there is a small number of edges. In this case the number of edges is considerably less than the maximum number of edges.</li>
</ul>

<p>Intuitively, we can think of dense and sparse in terms of populations. For example, if 100 people lived in a city block, we can consider that to be densely populated. If 100 people lived in 100 square miles we can consider that to be sparsely populated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some motivating examples to get an idea of how the different structures will handle these cases.</p>

<h2 id="list-or-matrix">List or Matrix?</h2>
<p>For dense graphs, the matrix representation will have better qualities as we are already setting aside space for the maximum number of edges. Sparse graphs are better represented in the list representation.</p>
<p>When we initialize the matrix implementation, we initialize the <code>nodes</code> attribute to have dimension equal to the capacity of the graph. The <code>edges</code> attribute is initialized to be a square matrix with dimension equal to capacity by capacity. Thus, if we have a sparse matrix, we are representing a lot of non-existent edges.</p>
<p>When we initialize the list implementation, we just have the <code>nodes</code> attribute which has dimension equal to the capacity and each node tracks its own edges. If we have a dense matrix and we are searching for an edge, we must loop through each edge from the target node to see if the edge exists. In the matrix representation, we can access that edge directly.</p>

<p>If the proportion of edges to the maximum number of edges is greater than 1/64, then the matrix representation is better in terms of space.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>In this module, we have introduced the graph data structure. We also looked at how we would implement a graph using a matrix representation. We introduced the following new concepts in this module:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Directed Graphs</code>: A directed graph is a graph that has a direction associated with each edge. The flat end of the arrow will represent the origin and the arrowhead will represent the destination. If an edge has no arrowheads, then it is assumed that we can traverse both directions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Edges</code>: Edges are the connection between two nodes. Depending on the data, edges can represent physical distance, films, cost, and much more.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Adjacent</code>: Node A and node B are said to be adjacent if there is an edge from node A to node B.</li>
<li><code>Neighbors</code>: The neighbors of a node are nodes which are adjacent to the node.</li>
<li><code>Undirected Edge</code>: An undirected edge is an edge which has no defined orientation (IE no arrowheads). If node A and node B are connected via an undirected edge then we say node A is adjacent to node B and node B is adjacent to node A.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Loops</code>: Loops are edges which connect a node to itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Nodes</code>: Node is the general term for a structure which contains an item.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Size</code>: The size of a graph is the number of nodes.</li>
<li><code>Capacity</code>: The capacity of a graph is the maximum number of nodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Weighted Graphs</code>: A weighted graph is a graph which has weights associated with the edges. These weights will quantify the  relationships so they can represent dollars, minutes, miles, and many other factors which our data may depend on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="matrix-representation">Matrix Representation</h2>
<p>Graphs can be represented using a matrix of edges between nodes.</p>

<h2 id="list-representation">List Representation</h2>
<p>In this module, we also introduced a new way to store the graph data structure. Thus, we now have two ways to work with graphs, in lists and in matrices:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-5527005e6f7995ebbf3341a91ee2a7b3" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="List Representation for Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphA_list_rep.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-5527005e6f7995ebbf3341a91ee2a7b3"><img alt="List Representation for Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphA_list_rep.svg"></a></p>
<p>While these methods show the same information, there are cases when one way may be more desirable than the other.</p>
<p>We discussed how a sparse graph is better suited for a list representation and a dense graph is better suited for a matrix representation. We also touched on how working with the edges in a list representation can add complexity to our edge functions. If we are needing to access edge weights or update edges frequently, a matrix representation would be a good choice &ndash; especially if we have a lot of nodes.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGiEVQE1hR4">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In the previous modules, we have introduced graphs and two implementations. This module will cover the traversals through graphs as well as path search techniques.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>As we have discussed previously, graphs can have many applications. Based on that, there are many things that we may want to infer from graphs. For example, if we have a graph that depicts a railroad or electrical network, we could determine what maximum flow of the network. The standard approach for this task is the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ford-fulkerson-algorithm-for-maximum-flow-problem/" rel="external" target="_blank">Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm</a>. In short, given a graph with edge weights that represent capacities the algorithm will determine the maximum flow throughout the graph.</p>
<p>From the matrix graph module, we used the following distribution network as an example.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-291db9f8c8d263856900410c50fa6770" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Sample Distribution Network" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/distribution-3.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-291db9f8c8d263856900410c50fa6770"><img alt="Sample Distribution Network" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/distribution-3.svg"></a></p>
<p>Conceptually, we would want to determine the maximum number of units that could leave the distribution center without having excess laying around stores. Using the maximum flow algorithm, we would determine that the maximum number of units would be 15.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-dd7073f290d545b0efd38024ec9c6261" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Max Flow" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/16/distribution-3MAX.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-dd7073f290d545b0efd38024ec9c6261"><img alt="Max Flow" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/16/distribution-3MAX.svg"></a></p>
<p>The driving force in the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, as well as other maximum flow algorithms, is the ability to find a path from a source to a target. Specifically, these algorithms use breadth first and depth first searches to discover possible paths.</p>
<h2 id="searching">Searching</h2>
<p>To get to introducing the searches, we will first discuss the basis of them. Those are the depth first traversal and the breadth first traversal. We will outline the premise of these traversals and then discuss how we can modify their algorithms for various tasks, such as path searches.</p>
<p>We can perform these traversals on any type of graph. Conceptually, it will help to have a tree-like structure in mind to differentiate between depth first and breadth first.</p>

<h1 id="depth-first">Depth First</h1>

<p>First we will discuss Depth First Traversal. We can define the depth first traversal in two ways, iteratively or recursively. For this course, we will define it iteratively.</p>
<p>In the iterative algorithm, we will initialize an empty stack and an empty set. The stack will determine which node we search next and the set will track which nodes we have already searched.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Recall that a stack is a &lsquo;Last In First Out&rsquo; (LIFO) structure. Based on this, the depth first traversal will traverse a nodes descendants before its siblings.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To do the traversal, we must pick a starting node; this can be an arbitrary node in our graph. If we were doing the traversal on a tree, we would typically select the root at a starting point. We start a while loop to go through the stack which we will be pushing and popping from. We get the top element of the stack, if the node has not been visited yet then we will add it to the set to note that we have now visited it. Then we get the neighbors of the node and put them onto the stack and continue the process until the stack is empty.</p>

<p>We can also perform a breadth first traversal either iteratively or recursively. As with the depth first traversal, we will define it iteratively.</p>
<p>In the iterative algorithm, we initialize an empty queue and an empty set. Like depth first traversal, the set will track which nodes we have discovered. We now use a queue to track which node we will search next.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Recall that a queue is a &lsquo;First In First Out&rsquo; (FIFO) structure. Based on this, the breadth first traversal will traverse a nodes siblings before its descendants.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Again, we must pick a starting node; this can be an arbitrary node in our graph. We add the starting node to our queue and the set of discovered nodes. We start a while loop to go through the queue which we will be enqueue  and dequeue from. We get the first element of the queue, then get the neighbors of the current node. We loop through each edge adding the neighbor to the discovered set and the queue if it has not already been discovered. We continue this process until the queue is empty.</p>

<p>It is important to remember in these implementations that a stack is used for depth first and a queue is used for a breadth first. The stack, being a LIFO structure, will proceed with the newest entry which will put us farther away from the source. The queue, being a FIFO structure, will proceed with oldest entry which will focus the algorithm more on the adjacent nodes. If we were to use say a queue for a depth first search, we would be traversing neighbors before descendants.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSz7UDs0cH8">YouTube Video</a>

<p>When introducing graphs, we discussed how the components of a graph didn&rsquo;t have to all be connected. If our goal is to visit each node, like in the searches, then we will need to perform the search from every node.</p>
<p>For example, the graph below has two separate components. Lets walk through which nodes we will discover by calling the traversals from each node.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-34cf911547e252a34132b30efdb10437" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Disconnected Graph" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/16/8search_dis.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<h1 id="pathfinding">Pathfinding</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKy-q1hWPpQ">YouTube Video</a>

<p>An important application for these traversals is the ability to find a path between two nodes. This has many applications in railroad networks as well as electrical wiring. With some modifications to the traversals, we can determine if electricity can flow from a source to a target. We will modify depth first and breadth first traversals in similar ways.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>There are three cases that can happen when we search for a path between nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>No Path: will return nothing</li>
<li>One Path: will return the path</li>
<li>Multiple Paths: will return A path</li>
</ul>
<p>With these searches, we are not guaranteed to return the same path if there are multiple paths.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We will call these Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS). In both traversals, we have added the following extra lines: 4, 9-16, and 22 through the end.</p>
<p>First, we have the addition of <code>PARENT_MAP</code> which will be a dictionary to keep track of how we get from one node to another. We will use the convention of having the key be the child and the value be the parent. While we use the terms child and parent, this is not exclusive to trees.</p>
<p>The ending portion starting at line 22, will add entries to our dictionary. If we haven&rsquo;t already found an edge to <code>NODE</code>, then we will add the edge that we are currently on.</p>
<p>The other addition is the block of code from line 9 to 16. We will enter this <code>if</code> block if the node that we are currently at is the target. This means that we have finally found a path from the source node to the target node. The process in this segment of code will backtrack through the path and build the path.</p>

<h2 id="traveling">Traveling</h2>
<p>Finding a path in a graph is a very common application in many fields. One application that we benefit from in our day to day lives is traveling. Programs like Google Maps calculate various paths from point A to point B.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-5c4715a68eac1219e6607357645d112d" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Google Map" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/16/Map.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-5c4715a68eac1219e6607357645d112d"><img alt="Google Map" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/16/Map.png"></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In the context of graph data structures, we can think of each intersection as a node and each road as an edge. Google Maps, however, tracks more features of edges than we have discussed. Not only do they track the distance between intersections, they also track time, tolls, construction, road surface and much more. In the next module, we will discuss more details of how we can find the shortest path.</p>
<h2 id="map-coloring">Map Coloring</h2>
<p>Another application of the general searches is coloring maps. The premise is that we don&rsquo;t want two adjacent territories to have the coloring. These territories could be states, like in the United States map below, counties, provinces, countries, and much more.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-fe509fc2c06dad5cd0cbbf8dcb09ede1" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="US Map" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/16/USMap.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>The following was generated for this course using the breadth first search and <code>MyMatrixGraph</code> class that we have implemented in this course. To create the visual rendering, the Python library <code>NetworkX</code>^[https://networkx.github.io/] was used. In this rendering, the starting node was Utah. If we were to start from say Alabama or Florida, we would not have a valid four coloring scheme once we got to Nevada. Since Hawaii and Alaska have no land border with any of the states, they can be any color.</p>

<h1 id="mst-introduction">MST Introduction</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtlwi7b_PF8">YouTube Video</a>

<p>We will continue to work with graph algorithms in this module, specifically with finding minimum spanning trees (MST). MSTs have many real world applications such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrical wiring,</li>
<li>Distribution networks,</li>
<li>Telecommunication networks, and</li>
<li>Network routing</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose we were building an apartment complex and wanted to determine the most cost-effective wiring schema. Below, we have the possible construction costs for wiring apartment to apartment. Wiring vertically adjacent apartments is cheaper than wiring horizontally adjacent units and those closest to the power closet have lower costs as well.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-a62276e9e288bf78c427964a1b93e8f2" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Possible Wiring" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/16/possibe_wiring.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>To find the best possible solution, we would find the MST. The final wiring schema may look something like the figure below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-707bb8a1443460e5f9ac473df7e7207d" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Possible Wiring" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/16/mini_wire.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Determining a MST can result in lower costs and time used in many applications, especially logistics.
To properly define a minimum spanning tree, we will first introduce the concept of a spanning tree.</p>
<h2 id="spanning-trees">Spanning Trees</h2>
<p>A <strong>spanning tree</strong> for a graph is a subset of the graphs edges such that each node is visited once, no cycles are present, and there are no disconnected components.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at this graph as an example. We have five nodes and seven edges.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-3f38ebf594284efe7fc2b4238c9020aa" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Graph" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/16/315_9_tree1.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-3f38ebf594284efe7fc2b4238c9020aa"><img alt="Graph" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/16/315_9_tree1.svg"></a></p>
<p>Below, we have valid examples of spanning trees. In each of the examples, we visit each node and there are no cycles. Recall that a cycle is a path in which the starting node and ending node are the same.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-3fdc6a0386a19d8a7d620e418872813e" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Spanning Trees" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/16/315_9_tree1STs.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<div class="box notices cstyle info">

  <div class="box-content">

<p>To be a spanning tree of a graph, it must:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>span</strong> the graph, meaning all nodes must be visited, and</li>
<li>be a <strong>tree</strong>, meaning there are no cycles and no disconnected components.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, we can imagine selecting a node in a spanning tree as the root and letting gravity take effect. This gives us a visual motivation as to why they are called spanning trees. In these examples, we have selected node A for the root for each of the spanning trees above.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMo3sTRoVrE">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Now that we have an understanding of general spanning trees, we will introduce the concept of minimum spanning trees. First let&rsquo;s introduce the concept of the cost of a tree.</p>
<p>The <strong>cost</strong> that is associated with a tree, is the sum of its edges weights. Let&rsquo;s look at this spanning tree which is from the previous page. The cost associated with this spanning tree is: <code>2+6+10+14=32</code>.</p>

<h3 id="minimum-spanning-trees-mst">Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)</h3>
<p>A <strong>minimum spanning tree</strong> is a spanning tree that has the smallest cost. Recall the graph from the previous page.</p>

<p>In this small example, it is rather straightforward to find the minimum spanning tree. We can use a bit of trial and error to determine if we have the minimum spanning tree or not. However, once the graphs start to get more nodes and more edges it quickly becomes more complicated.</p>

<p>There are two algorithms that we will introduce to give us a methodical way of finding the minimum spanning tree. The first that we will look at is Kruskal&rsquo;s algorithm and then we will look at Prim&rsquo;s algorithm.</p>

<p>As graphs get larger, it is important to go about finding the MST in a methodical way. In the mid 1950&rsquo;s, there was a desire to form an algorithmic approach for solving the &rsquo;traveling salesperson&rsquo; problem^[We will describe this problem in a future section of this module]. Joseph Kruskal first published this algorithm in 1956 in the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The algorithms prior to this were, as Kruskal said, &ldquo;unnecessarily elaborate&rdquo; thus the need for a more succinct algorithm arose.</p>
<h3 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h3>
<p>In his original work, Kruskal outlined three different yet similar algorithms to finding a minimum spanning tree. The <code>Kruskal Algorithm</code> that we use is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with only the nodes of the graph and an empty set for the edges</li>
<li>Order the edges based on weight</li>
<li>Make each node their own set</li>
<li>Go through the edges in ascending order</li>
<li>If nodes <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> are connected by the edge and they are not in the same set yet, then join the two sets and add the edge to your set of edges</li>
</ol>

<p>The history of <code>Prim's Algorithm</code> is not as straight forward as Kruskal&rsquo;s. While we often call it <code>Prim's Algorithm</code>, it was originally developed in 1930 by Vojtěch Jarník. Robert Prim later rediscovered and republished this algorithm in 1957, one year after Kruskals. To add to the naming confusion, Edsger Dijkstra also published this work again in 1959. Because of this, the algorithm can go by many names: <code>Jarkík's Algorithm</code>, <code>Jarník-Prim's Algorithm</code>, <code>Prim-Dijkstra's Algorithm</code>, and <code>DJP Algorithm</code>.</p>
<p>Prim cited &ldquo;large-scale communication&rdquo; as the motivation for this algorithm, specifically the &ldquo;Bell System leased-line&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Leased lines were used primarily in a commercial setting which connected business offices that were geographically distant (IE in different cities or even states). Companies would want all offices to be connected but wanted to avoid having to lay an excessive amount of wire. Below is a figure which Prim used to motivate the need for the algorithm. This image depicts the minimum spanning tree which connect each of the US continental state capitals along with Washington D.C.</p>

<h3 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h3>
<p>The basis of the algorithm is to start with only the nodes of the graph, then we do the following</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a random node</li>
<li>Grow your tree by one edge, selecting the smallest edge to connect to a node that is not yet in the tree. Repeat until all the nodes have been visited</li>

<p>While these are different, they are both valid. The trees both have cost 16. The MST of a graph will be unique, meaning there is only one, if none of the edges of the graph have the same weight.</p>

<p>While we won&rsquo;t outline algorithms suited for solving the traveling salesperson problem (TSP), we will outline the premise of the problem. This problem was first posed in 1832, almost a two centuries ago, and is still quite prevalent. It is applicable to traveling routes, distribution networks, computer architecture and much more. The TSP is a seminal problem that has motivated many research breakthroughs, including Kruskal&rsquo;s algorithm!</p>
<p>The motivation of the TSP is this: given a set of locations, what is the shortest path such that we can visit each location and end back where started?</p>
<p>Suppose we wanted to take a road trip with friends to every state capital in the continental US as well as Washington D.C. To save money and time, we would want to minimize the distance that we travel. Since we are taking a road trip, we would want to avoid frivolous driving. For example, if we start in Sacremento, CA we would not want to end the trip in Boston, MA. The trip should start and end at the same location for efficiency.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the shortest trip that visits each state capital and Washington D.C. once. In this example, we can start where ever we like and will end up where we started.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-b062af66c23739043244e36e6a5a29d7" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Visit each state capital" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/16/7_TSP_TOUR.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-b062af66c23739043244e36e6a5a29d7"><img alt="Visit each state capital" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/16/7_TSP_TOUR.png"></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In this problem, it is easy to get overwhelmed by all of the possibilities. Since there are 49 cities to visit, there are over <code>6.2*10^60</code> possibilities. For reference, <code>10^12</code> is equivalent to one trillion! Thus, we need an algorithmic approach to solve this problem as opposed to a brute force method.</p>

<p>The next data structure we will cover is heaps. The heaps discussed in this course are not to be confused with heaps which refer to garbage collection in certain coding languages. Heaps are good for situations were we will need to frequently access and update the highest (or lowest) priority item in a set. For example, heaps are a good data structure to use in Prim&rsquo;s algorithm. In Prim&rsquo;s algorithm, we repeatedly got the smallest edge, removed the smallest edge, and then added to and sorted the list of edges.</p>
<h3 id="heap-properties">Heap Properties</h3>
<p>A heap is an array which we can view as an unsorted binary tree. This tree must have the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each node has at most two children.</li>
<li>If there are nodes in level <code>i</code> of the tree, then level <code>i-1</code> is full. Below we have an example of how this property has been broken. Level two is not full but there are nodes on level three.

<h3 id="types-of-heaps">Types of Heaps</h3>
<p>There are two main types of heaps, the max-heap and the min-heap. Depending on the element we want to access we may use one or the other.</p>
<p>A <strong>max-heap</strong> is a heap such that the parent node is greater than or equal to the children. For example, if we are using a heap to track work flow,we would want to use a max-heap. In this case, the highest priority element will always be the root of the tree.</p>
<p>A <strong>min-heap</strong> is a heap such that the parent node is less than or equal to the children. This is the opposite of the max-heap. The root of this heap will be the item with the lowest priority. A min-heap may feel unnatural at first, however, this is ideal for greedy algorithms such as Prim&rsquo;s algorithm. We are frequently getting the smallest edge.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZZiihhBXco">YouTube Video</a>

<p>Heaps can be viewed in two forms: as a tree or as an array. We will use the array style in code but we can have the tree structure in the back of our mind to help understand the order of the data. Here is an example of the heap as a tree on the left and the heap as an array on the right.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-c9d942ba694df814a136026d2b499217" class="lightbox-link"><img class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/17/Mod10_heap_and_array_numbered.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>The root of the heap will always be the first element. Then we can base the numbering of the following nodes from left to right and top to bottom. For example, the left child of the root will be the second entry and the right child will be the third.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-indices">Accessing Indices</h3>
<p>For full functionality of our heap, we want to be able to easily determine the parent of a node as well as the children of a node.</p>

<p>Using just the array, how can we determine the parent of a node? In the example above, how can we determine the parent of the node with value 18?</p>

<p>We can formulate the relationships between parent and children nodes mathematically. For a node at index <code>i</code>, we can say that the left child of <code>i</code> will be at index <code>2i</code> and the right child will be at <code>2i+1</code>. Similarly, we can say that the parent of node <code>i</code> will be at index <code>floor(i/2)</code>.</p>

<p>For example, if we ask for the parent of the node with value 27, our answer would be the node with value 35 The node with value 27 has index 5. Thus, the parent of that node will have index <code>floor(5/2)=2</code>. Node 35 is at index two, as such, node 35 is the parent of node 27.</p>

<h1 id="priority-queues">Priority Queues</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1t017tFAvA">YouTube Video</a>

<p>A natural implementation of heaps is priority queues.</p>
<p>A <strong>priority queue</strong> is a data structure which contains elements and each element has an associated key value. The key for an element corresponds to its importance. In real world applications, these can be used for prioritizing work tickets, emails, and much more.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-87fbed66bd81bf615b6c2b266c9d0cc2" class="lightbox-link"><img class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/17/todo_bubble.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-87fbed66bd81bf615b6c2b266c9d0cc2"><img class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/17/todo_bubble.svg"></a></p>
<p>We can use a heap to organize this data for us.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-371becde7a3f88de41c7a6314b65789f" class="lightbox-link"><img class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/17/todo_tree_array.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>As with heaps, we can have min-priority queues and max-priority queues. For the applications listed above, a max-priority queue is the most intuitive choice. For this course however, we will focus more on min-priority queues which will give us better functionality for greedy algorithms, like Prim&rsquo;s algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="prims-revisited">Prim&rsquo;s Revisited</h3>
<p>For the minimum spanning tree algorithms, using a min-priority queue helps the performance of the algorithms. Recall Prim&rsquo;s algorithm, shown below. Each time we visited a new node, we would add the outgoing edges to the list of available edges, remove the smallest edge, and sort the list.</p>

<p>A good application of priority queues is finding the shortest path in a graph. A common algorithm for this is Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm.</p>
<p>Edsger Dijkstra was a Dutch computer scientist who researched many fields. He is credited for his work in physics, programming, software engineering, and as a systems scientist. His motivation for this algorithm in particular was to be able to find the shortest path between two cities.</p>

<p>Aside from just finding routes for us to travel, Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm can accommodate for any application that can have an abstraction to finding the shortest path. For example, the following animation shows how a robot could utilize Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm to find the shortest path with an obstacle in the way. In this example, each node could represent one square foot of floor space and the edges would represent those spaces that are adjacent. In this scenario, we would most likely not have an associated edge weight. If the robot were traversing on a rugged terrain, then we could have the weights represent the difficultly of passing through the terrain from one space to the other.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-c1a2a74316266e728dfd8a36870eabe1" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Robot Path Mapping" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/17/Dijkstras_progress_animation.gif" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Another practical abstraction is in network routing. In this simplified abstraction, nodes would be routers or switches and the edges would be the physical links between them. The edge weights in this case would be the cost of sending a packet from one router to the next. Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm is actively used in protocols such as Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF).</p>

<p>In this module, we will reintroduce the data structures that we have seen and implemented throughout CC 315 as well as CC 310. We will discuss the running time for various operations as well as space requirements for each structure.</p>
<p>You may recall that in CC 310, we did a similar comparison. We will use most of the same operations from that module so we can draw comparisons between the structures in CC 310 and CC 315.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insert</strong> – inserting a specific element into the structure, either in sorted order, or at the appropriate place as required by the definition of the data structure.</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong> – accessing a desired element. For general data structures, this is the process of accessing an element by its index or key in the structure. For stacks and queues, this was the process of accessing the next element to be returned.</li>
<li><strong>Find</strong> – this is the process of finding a specific element in the data structure, usually by iterating through it or using a search method if the structure is ordered in some way.</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong> – this is the process of deleting a specific element in the case of a general-purpose structure or deleting and returning the next element in the case of a stack or queue. For more advanced structures, this may also require the structure to be reorganized a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also also discuss the memory required for each structure.</p>

<h1 id="trees">Trees</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygzji6IOd18">YouTube Video</a>

<p>There are three types of trees to consider: generic trees, tries, and binary trees.</p>
<h3 id="general-trees">General Trees</h3>
<p><a href="#R-image-a9fc132609506664395a5d00b5efe7e3" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_Implementation.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-a9fc132609506664395a5d00b5efe7e3"><img alt="Tree" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/2Tree_Implementation.svg"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Insert</strong>: In general, inserting an element into a tree by making it a child of an existing tree is a constant time operation. However, this depends on us already having access to the parent tree we&rsquo;d like to add the item to, which may require searching for that element in the tree as discussed below, which runs in linear time based on the size of the tree. As we saw in our projects, one way we can simplify this is using a hash table to help us keep track of the tree nodes while we build the tree, so that we can more quickly access a desired tree (in near constant time) and add a new child to that tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access</strong>: Again, this is a bit complex, as it requires us to make some assumptions about what information is available to us. Typically, we can only access the root element of a tree, which can be done in constant time. If we&rsquo;d like to access any of the other nodes in the tree, we&rsquo;ll have to traverse the tree to find them, either by searching for them if we don&rsquo;t know the path to the item (which is linear time based on the size of the tree), or directly walking the tree in the case that we do know the path (which is comparable to the length of the path, or linear based on the height of the tree).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find</strong>: Finding a particular node in a generic tree is a linear time operation based on the number of nodes in the tree. We simply must do a full traversal of the tree until we find the element we are searching for, typically either by performing a preorder or postorder traversal. This is very similar to simply looking at each element in a linear data structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delete</strong>: Removing a child from an existing tree is an interesting operation. If we&rsquo;ve already located the tree node that is the parent of the element we&rsquo;d like to remove, and we know which child we&rsquo;d like to remove, then the operation would be a linear time operation related to the number of children of that node. This is because we may have to iterate through the children of that tree node in order to find the one we&rsquo;d like to remove. Recall that trees generally store the children of each node in a linked list or an array, so the time it takes to remove a child is similar to the time it takes to remove an element from those structures. Again, if we have to search for either the parent or the tree node we&rsquo;d like to remove from that parent, we&rsquo;ll have to take that into account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Memory</strong>: In terms of memory usage, a generic tree uses memory that is on the order of the number of nodes in the tree. So, as the number of nodes in the tree is doubled, the amount of memory it uses doubles as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tries">Tries</h3>
<p><a href="#R-image-08d168e516941ea0e53bf52efdf3e235" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Trie 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/4Trie_Tree1.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-08d168e516941ea0e53bf52efdf3e235"><img alt="Trie 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/4Trie_Tree1.svg"></a></p>
<p>Tries improve on the structure of trees in one important way - instead of using a generic list to store each child, they typically use a statically sized array, where each index in the array directly corresponds to one of the possible children that the node could have. In the case of a trie that represents words, each tree node may have an array of 26 possible children, one for each letter of the alphabet. In our implementation, we chose to use lists instead to simplify things a bit, but for this analysis we&rsquo;ll assume that the children of a trie node can be accessed in constant time through the use of these static arrays.</p>
<p>In the analysis below, we&rsquo;ll assume that we are dealing with words in a trie, not individual nodes. We&rsquo;re also going to be always starting with the root node of the overall trie data structure.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Insert</strong>: To insert a new word in a trie, the process will run in linear time based on the length of the word. So, to insert a 10 character word in a trie, it should take on the order of 10 steps. This is because we can find each individual node for each character in constant time since we are using arrays as described above, and we&rsquo;ll need to do that once for each character, so the overall time is linear based on the number of characters. If the path doesn&rsquo;t exist, we&rsquo;ll have to create new tree nodes to fill it in, but if the path does exist, it could be as simple as setting the boolean value at the correct node to indicate that it is indeed a word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access</strong>: Similarly to determine if a particular word is in the trie, it will also run in linear time based on the length of the word. We simply must traverse through the path in the tree, and at each node it is a constant time operation to find the correct child and continue onward. So, in total this is a linear time operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find</strong>: Find is pretty much the same as access, since we can&rsquo;t just directly jump to a particular node in the tree. So, this is also in linear time based on the length of the word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delete</strong>: Once again, deleting a word simply involves finding it, which runs in linear time. Once it is deleted, we may go through and prune branches that are unused, which is also a linear time operation as we work back upwards in the trie. So, overall the whole operation runs in linear time based on the length of the word.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, pretty much every operation performed on a trie is related to the length of the word that is provided as input. Pretty nifty!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory</strong>: Analyzing the memory usage of a trie is a bit more interesting. Traditionally, we say that the memory consumed by a trie is on the order of $n * m$, where $n$ is the number of words stored in the trie, and $m$ is the length of the longest word in the trie. We come to this value because there could be $n$ words that do not share any prefixes, and if they are all the same length $n$ then we&rsquo;ll need that many nodes to represent the whole trie. However, in practice the actual memory usage may be somewhat less because of the shared prefixes and shorter words being part of longer words, but remember that we are concerned with the <strong>worst case</strong> memory usage for a trie, which is $n * m$.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="binary-trees">Binary Trees</h3>
<p><a href="#R-image-5b97e2d698fc907e769386945f549837" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Tree 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/4Binary_Tree1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-5b97e2d698fc907e769386945f549837"><img alt="Tree 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/14/4Binary_Tree1.png"></a></p>
<p>A binary tree is a tree that is limited to having only two children of each node, and the children and parents are sorted such that every element to the left of the node is less than or equal to its value, and all elements to the right of the node are greater than or equal to its value. Because of this, they perform a little differently than traditional trees.</p>
<p>One major concept related to binary trees is whether the tree is &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; or not. A balanced tree has children that differ in <em>height</em> by no more than 1. If the tree is <em>perfectly</em> balanced, meaning all subtrees are balanced, then there are some interesting relationships that develop.</p>
<p>Most notably, the overall height $h$ of the tree is no larger than $log_2(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the tree.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t cover the algorithms to balance a binary tree in this course since they can be a bit complex, but for this analysis we&rsquo;ll discuss the performance of binary trees when they are perfectly balanced as well as when they are unbalanced.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Insert</strong>: To insert a new element in a binary tree, we may have to descend all the way to the bottom of the tree, so the operation is linear based on the height of the tree. If the tree is a perfectly balanced binary tree, then it is on the order of $log_2(n)$. Otherwise, it is linear based on the height, which in the worst case of a completely unbalanced tree could be the number of nodes itself. Once you&rsquo;ve added the new item, a perfectly balance tree may need to rebalance itself, but that operation is not any more costly than the insert operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access</strong>: Similarly, to access a particular element in a binary tree, we&rsquo;ll have to descend through the tree until we find the element we are looking for. At each level, we know exactly which child to check, so it is once again related to the height of the tree. If the tree is a perfectly balanced binary tree, then it is on the order of $log_2(n)$. Otherwise, it is linear based on the height, which in the worst case of a completely unbalanced tree could be the number of nodes itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find</strong>: Once again, find in this instance is similar to access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delete</strong>: Finally, deleting an element from a binary tree involves finding the element, which will be linear based on the height of the tree. Once the element is removed, then a perfectly balanced tree will need to rebalance itself, which could also take the same amount of time. So, in both cases, it runs on the order of $h$ time, which in the worst case is the total number of nodes $n$ on an unbalanced tree, or $log_2(n)$ on a perfectly balanced tree.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, most operations involving a perfectly balanced binary tree run in $log_2(n)$ time, which is very efficient when compared to a generic tree. However, if the tree is not balanced, then we cannot make any assumptions about the height of the tree and each operation could require $n$ time, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory</strong>: The memory usage of a binary tree is directly correlated with the number of nodes, so we typically say that it is on the order of $n$ memory usage.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="graphs">Graphs</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd2_k51IFsw">YouTube Video</a>

<p>There are two types of graphs that we&rsquo;ve covered in this class: list graphs and matrix graphs. Graphs are slightly different than other data structures, because we may want to find or access both nodes and edges in the graph. So, we&rsquo;ll need to analyze the performance of graphs with respect to both nodes and edges.</p>
<h3 id="matrix-graph">Matrix Graph</h3>
<p><a href="#R-image-9a71cd36e90567a5baf7ddba7aa51b52" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Matrix Representation Example 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphB.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<a href="#R-image-d5d2519df46e0d0adfe4a982632d6255" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Matrix Representation Example 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/matrixB.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-d5d2519df46e0d0adfe4a982632d6255"><img alt="Matrix Representation Example 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/matrixB.svg"></a></p>
<p>Recall that a matrix graph uses an array to store the nodes, and a two-dimensional array to store the edges.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Insert Node</strong>: Inserting a node is a linear time operation. To insert node, we looped through the nodes attribute and put the node in the first open index. Thus, it is linear with respect to the number of nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Node</strong>: Likewise, given the index of a node, we can get it&rsquo;s value in constant time by accessing the array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find Node</strong>: To find the index of a node when we are given its value, we must iterate through the array of nodes, which will be a linear time operation based on the number of nodes in the graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delete Node</strong>: Finally, to remove a node from a graph we can simply set its value in the array of nodes to <code>null</code>. However, we may also need to go through the list of edges and make sure there are no edges to or from that node, so typically this operation runs on the order of the number of nodes in the graph since we must check each one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the operations relating to edges below, we&rsquo;ll assume that we already know the indices of the two nodes we are connecting. If we don&rsquo;t know those, we&rsquo;ll have to use the find node process above first.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Insert Edge</strong>: To insert an edge into the graph we simply update the element in the two-dimensional array, which can be done in constant time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Edge</strong>: Likewise, to access an edge between two nodes, we simply access the element in the two-dimensional array, which is a constant time operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find Neighbors</strong>: Instead of finding a particular edge, we&rsquo;ll say that we want to find all of the neighboring nodes that can be accessed from a given node. In this case, we&rsquo;ll need to iterate through one row of the two-dimensional array, so the whole process runs on the order of linear time based on the number of nodes in the graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delete Edge</strong>: To remove an edge, we simply find it in the two-dimensional array and set its value to infinity, which can be done in constant time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for most matrix graph operations, we can do nearly everything in either constant time or, at worst, linear time based on the number of nodes in the graph.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory</strong>: Here is where things get interesting. Generally, we say that a matrix graph consumes $n^2$ memory, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because the two-dimensional array of edges is the vast majority of the memory consumption in a matrix graph. So, if the number of nodes is doubled, the memory usage will quadruple.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="list-graph">List Graph</h3>
<p><a href="#R-image-3d5c23bfab1fc35a79a68817a488db1a" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphA.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<a href="#R-image-60d816bb71ff573d78eeb0d484adb183" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="List Representation for Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphA_list_rep.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-60d816bb71ff573d78eeb0d484adb183"><img alt="List Representation for Example 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/15/graphA_list_rep.svg"></a></p>
<p>Recall that a list graph uses an array to store the nodes, and then each node stores a list of edges that start from that node.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Insert Node</strong>: Inserting a node is a linear time operation. To insert node, we looped through the nodes attribute and put the node in the first open index. Thus, it is linear with respect to the number of nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Node</strong>: Likewise, given the index of a node, we can get it&rsquo;s value in constant time by accessing the array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find Node</strong>: To find the index of a node when we are given its value, we must iterate through the array of nodes, which will be a linear time operation based on the number of nodes in the graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delete Node</strong>: Finally, to remove a node from a graph we can simply set its value in the array of nodes to <code>null</code>. However, we may also need to go through each other node and check to make sure it isn&rsquo;t in the list of edges. So typically this operation runs on the order of the number of nodes in the graph since we must check each one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, a list graph seems to be pretty similar to a matrix graph in terms of performance. The real difference comes with how we handle edges, as well see next.</p>
<p>For the operations relating to edges below, we&rsquo;ll assume that we already know the indices of the two nodes we are connecting. If we don&rsquo;t know those, we&rsquo;ll have to use the find node process above first.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Insert Edge</strong>: To insert an edge into the graph, we must get the source node from the nodes array and then add an element to the list of edges. Assuming that the edges are stored in a linked list, this is a linear time operation in terms of the number of nodes since we may have to iterate through the list of edges to make sure this edge doesn&rsquo;t already exist and need updated. In the worst case, there may be $n$ edges here, so it is a linear operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Edge</strong>: To access an edge between two nodes, we first find the source node in the list of nodes, which is a constant time operation. Then, we&rsquo;ll have to iterate through the list of edges, which is at worst linear time based on the size of the graph, since there could be $n$ outgoing edges from this node. So, overall the operation runs on the order of linear time based on the number of nodes in the graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find Neighbors</strong>: Instead of finding a particular edge, we&rsquo;ll say that we want to find all of the neighboring nodes that can be accessed from a given node. In this case, we can just find the source node in the array of nodes, which is a constant time operation. Then, we can simply return the list of edges, which is also constant time. So, this operation is very efficient!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delete Edge</strong>: To remove an edge, we find the source node and iterate through the list of edges until we find the one to remove. So, this runs in linear time based on the number of nodes in the graph.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for most list graph operations, we can also do nearly everything in either constant time or, at worst, linear time based on the number of nodes in the graph. The only real difference comes in how we handle edges, where some operations are a bit slower, but getting a list of all the neighbors of a node is actually a little quicker!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory</strong>: For a list graph, we typically say the memory usage is on the order of $n + e$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph and $e$ is the number of edges in the graph.</li>
</ul>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Dense vs. Sparse Graphs</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Let&rsquo;s analyze the memory usage of matrix and list graphs when dealing with dense and sparse graphs. This is the real key difference between the two data structures.</p>
<h3 id="dense-graph">Dense Graph</h3>
<p>A dense graph is a graph that has a large number of edges compared to the maximum number of edges possible. More specifically, the maximum number of edges a graph can have is $n^2$, so we would say a dense graph has a value for $e$ that is close to $n^2$. Because of this, the memory usage of a matrix graph ($n^2$) is actually a bit more efficient than a list graph ($n + n^2$) because it doesn&rsquo;t have the extra overhead of maintaining a list structure for each node.</p>
<h3 id="sparse-graph">Sparse Graph</h3>
<p>A sparse graph is a graph that has a small number of edges compared to the maximum number of edges possible. So, here we would say that the value of $e$ is much smaller than $n^2$, though it may still be larger than $n$ (otherwise each node would only have one edge coming from it, and this would be a linked list). In that case, we see that $n + e$ is much smaller than $n^2$, and a list graph is much more efficient. If you think about it, in a matrix graph a large number of the entries in the two-dimensional array would be set to infinity and unused, but they still take up memory. Those unused edges wouldn&rsquo;t exist in a list graph, making it much more memory efficient.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the performance of priority queues next. These structures are based on a heap, which has some unique characteristics related to the <em>heap properties</em> that it must maintain.</p>
<p>Recall that a heap is an array which we can view as an unsorted binary tree. This tree must have the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each node has at most two children.</li>
<li>If there are nodes in level <code>i</code> of the tree, then level <code>i-1</code> is full.</li>
<li>The nodes of the last level are as far left as possible.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Insert</strong> To insert a new element in a priority queue, we place it at the end and then push it upwards until it is in the correct place. Because the heap property creates a perfectly balanced tree, at most it will have to perform $log_2(n)$ or $h$ operations. So, we say that insert runs on the order of $log_2(n)$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the heap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Minimum</strong> The most common operation for accessing elements in the priority queue is to access the minimum element. Since it should always be the first element in the array due to the heap properties, this is clearly a constant time operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find Element</strong> To find an item in a priority queue, we must simply iterate through the array that stores the heap, which is a linear time operation based on the number of elements in the heap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remove Minimum</strong> To remove the smallest element, we swap it with the last element and then remove it, then push the top element down into place. Similar to the push up operation, at most it will perform $log_2(n)$ or $h$ operations. So, we say that remove minimum runs on the order of $log_2(n)$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the heap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heapify</strong> This is the most interesting operation of a heap. When we use heapify, we add a large number of elements to the heap and then sort it exactly once by working from the bottom to the top and pushing down each element into place. On the surface, it appears that this should run in the order $n * log_2(n)$ time, since each push down operation takes $log_2(n)$ time, and we have to do that on the order of $n$ times to get each element in place. However, using a bit of mathematical analysis, it is possible to prove that this operation actually runs in linear time $n$ based on the number of elements. The work to actually prove this is a bit beyond the scope of this course, but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9755721/how-can-building-a-heap-be-on-time-complexity" rel="external" target="_blank">this StackOverflow discussion</a> is a great explanation of how it works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Memory</strong>: In terms of memory usage, a priority queue uses memory that is on the order of the number of elements in the priority queue.</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Heapify and Heap Sort</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Why is it important that heapify runs in linear time? That is because we can use heapify and remove minimum to sort data, which is a sorting algorithm known as heap sort.</p>
<p>We already saw that heapify runs in linear time based on the number of nodes, and each remove minimum operation runs in $log_2(n)$ time. To remove all the elements of the heap, we would do that $n$ times, so the overall time would be $n * log_2(n)$ time. If you recall, that is the same performance as merge sort and quicksort!</p>

<h1 id="tree-algorithms">Tree Algorithms</h1>

<p>We will now discuss the performance of the algorithms that we discussed in this course. When examining the performance of an algorithm we will look at the time and the space that it will require.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: To analyze the time of an algorithm, we will look at the number of operations required to complete the algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Space</strong>: To analyze the space requirement of an algorithm, we will look at the various variables within the algorithm. To calculate this, we can add up the space requirements for each variable within the algorithm</li>
</ul>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">   append ITEM to RESULT
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: The time required for preorder or postorder traversals will be linear with respect to the number of nodes. In a single iteration, we will execute the appending once and we will execute the for loop for each child.</li>
<li><strong>Space</strong>: Since <code>RESULT</code> is a variable defined and stored outside of the algorithm, it does not factor into our space requirement. Then we must account for the variables <code>CHILD</code> and <code>CHILDREN</code>. In any given iteration, <code>CHILD</code> will be constant and <code>CHILDREN</code> will have size equal to the number of children for the node we are currently at. In total, this would give us a space requirement that is linear with respect to the number of nodes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="inorder">Inorder</h3>

<li><strong>Time</strong>: For any given call to the inorder traversal, it will execute in constant time. We must factor in that we have a recursive function and as such, we will call the inorder traversal for each node. Thus our time requirement will be linear with respect to the number of nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Space</strong>: Since <code>RESULT</code> is a variable defined and stored outside of the algorithm, it does not factor into our space requirement. Then we must account for the variable <code>ITEM</code>. This will have constant space and thus, the space requirement for the inorder traversal is constant.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: The time analysis for the depth first search can be a bit complex. Lines 1 through 5 would execute in near constant time. When we start the while loop on line 6, it is more difficult to analyze how many times this can execute as <code>STACK</code> can contain duplicates. In the case that we have a sparse graph, this would be bound by the number of nodes. For a dense graph however, the number of executions would be bound by the number of edges. The code within the while loop would be bound by the number of nodes because of the check that we have not already discovered the node in line 8. If we haven&rsquo;t discovered it, we would take either the logic of lines 8 through 16 or lines 17 through 23 but never both in the same iteration. Both of these blocks are bound by the number of nodes in our graph. Thus the worst case time requirement would be $n^2$.</li>
<li><strong>Space</strong>: Depending on the density of our graph, the space required will be linear with respect to the number of nodes or edges. This is due to the fact that <code>STACK</code> can contain duplicate nodes. If we have a sparse graph then it will be bound by the number of nodes. If we have a dense graph then the space is bound by the number of edges.

<li><strong>Time</strong>: The run time expected for breadth first search is a bit more straight forward as <code>QUEUE</code> will never have duplicates. Lines 1 through 6 will all execute in constant time. The while loop will occur $n$ times where $n$ is the number of nodes. Based on the logic, either 9-16 will execute or 17-24 will execute. Both of these are bound by the number of nodes in terms of time. Each iteration of the while loop will take $n$ time and we do the while loop $n$ times; thus the running time will be $n^2$.</li>
<li><strong>Space</strong>: The space required for BFS will be linear with respect to the number of nodes. We have 5 variables which have size bound by the number of nodes. If the number of nodes doubles, then we expect the amount of space to roughly double.

<li><strong>Time without Priority Queue</strong>: The time to initialize <code>MST</code> would be linear with respect to the number of nodes. Regardless of the graph implementation, inserting nodes is constant time and we would do it for the number of nodes in <code>GRAPH</code>. With a matrix graph, setting up <code>AVAILEDGES</code> would take linear time with respect to the number of nodes. With a list graph, this would happen in constant time. Then, we need to get the smallest edge from the <code>AVAILEDGES</code> list, which would be a linear time operation based on the number of edges, and we must do that once for up to each edge in the graph. So, the worst case running time for Prim&rsquo;s algorithm is $e^2$. (Our implementation is actually a bit slower than this since we sort the list of available edges each time, but that is technically not necessary - our implementation is closer to $e^2 \times log_2(e)$!)</li>
<li><strong>Time with Priority Queue</strong>: We do get an improvement when we choose to implement this with a priority queue. For the most part, the performance is the same. Using a priority queue, heapify would optimize the sorting to happen in linear time with respect to the number of elements. In that case, we can reduce the total running time to on the order of $e \times log_2(n)$, which is the same as Kruskal&rsquo;s algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Space</strong>: The required space for Prim&rsquo;s algorithm is also dependent on the implementation of the MST. A matrix graph would require $n^2$ space and a list graph we would require $n+e$ space.

<ul>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: The time required for Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm will be $n^2$ in the worst case. We would expect lines 1 through 8 to take constant time. The for loop on line 9 would be bound by the number of nodes. We would expect the for loop on line 13 to be bound by the number of nodes. This for loop will execute each time <code>PQ</code> is not empty (line 11), which is bound by the number of nodes. Thus, the block of code starting at 11 will take $n^2$ time to run in the worst case. This means that if we double the number of nodes, then the running time will be quadrupled. The worst case for Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm is characterized by being a very dense graph, meaning each node has a lot of neighbors. If the graph is sparse and our priority queue is efficient, we could expect this running time to be more along the lines of $(n + e) \times log_2(n)$, where $e$ is the number of edges.</li>
<li><strong>Space</strong>: The required space for Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm will be linear with respect to the number of nodes. We have 4 variables which have linear size with respect to the number of nodes. We say that this is linear because if we were to double the number of nodes, we would roughly double the space requirement.

<h3 id="stacks">Stacks</h3>
<p>A stack is a data structure with two main operations that are simple in concept. One is the <code>push</code> operation that lets you put data into the data structure and the other is the <code>pop</code> operation that lets you get data out of the structure.</p>
<p>A stack is what we call a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. That means that when we <code>pop</code> a piece of data off the stack, we get the last piece of data we put on the stack.</p>
<h3 id="queues">Queues</h3>
<p>A queue data structure organizes data in a First In, First Out (FIFO) order: the first piece of data put into the queue is the first piece of data available to remove from the queue.</p>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>A list is a data structure that holds a sequence of data, such as the shopping list shown below. Each list has a head item and a tail item, with all other items placed linearly between the head and the tail.</p>
<h3 id="sets">Sets</h3>
<p>A set is a collection of elements that are usually related to each other.</p>
<h3 id="hash-tables">Hash Tables</h3>
<p>A hash table is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.</p>
<p>The following table compares the best- and worst-case processing time for many common data structures and operations, expressed in terms of $N$, the number of elements in the structure.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSC3F4OdGg0">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In this module, we will discuss how we can determine which data structure we should choose when storing real-world data. We&rsquo;ll typically make this decision based on the characteristics of the data we would like to store. In general, the data structures we&rsquo;ve learned often work together well and complement each other, as we saw in Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm. In some cases, one structure can be utilized to implement another, such as using a linked list to implement a stack or a queue.</p>
<p>When selecting a data structure for a particular data set, there are a few considerations we should keep in mind.</p>
<h3 id="does-it-work">Does it Work?</h3>
<p>The first consideration is: does this data structure work for our data? To answer this, we would want to the characteristics in the data and then determine if our chosen data structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>maintains relationships between elements?</li>
<li>translates well to the real world data?</li>
<li>efficiently stores the data without extra overhead?</li>
<li>can store all aspects of the data clearly and concisely?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="will-someone-else-understand">Will Someone Else Understand?</h3>
<p>Once we have chosen a possible data structure, we also must consider if the choice clearly makes sense to another person who reviews our work. Some questions we may want to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>is this a natural choice?</li>
<li>if I look back at this 6 months from now, would I understand it?</li>
<li>do I need to provide extra comments or documentation to explain this choice?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="does-it-perform-well">Does it Perform Well?</h3>
<p>Finally, we should always consider the performance of our program when selecting a data structure. In some cases, the most straightforward data structure may not always be the most efficient, so at times there is a trade off between performance and simplicity. Consider the hash table structure - it may seem like a more complicated array or linked list. But, if we need to find a specific item in the structure, a hash table is typically <strong>much</strong> faster due to the use of hashes. That increase in complexity pays off in faster performance. So, when analyzing data structures for performance, we typically look at these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>performance time for tasks</li>
<li>space requirements</li>
<li>complexity of the code</li>
</ul>
<p>We will address this particular facet in the next chapter. For now, we will focus on the first two portions.</p>

<h1 id="types-of-data">Types of Data</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcFgY09EWmk">YouTube Video</a>

<p>The first step toward determining which data structure to use relies heavily on the format of the data. By looking at the data and trying to understand what it contains and how it works, we can get a better idea of what data structure would work best to represent the data. Here, we will discuss some main types of data that we could encounter.</p>
<h3 id="unique">Unique</h3>
<p>Unique data is the type of data where each element in a group must be unique - there can be no duplicates. However, in many cases the data itself doesn&rsquo;t have a sequence or fixed ordering, we simply care if an element is present in the group or not. Some examples of unique data:</p>
<ul>
<li>car license plates</li>
<li>personnel ID badge numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is best stored in the <strong>set</strong> data structure, usually built using a hash table as we learned previously.</p>
<p>However, many times this data may be included along with other data (a person&rsquo;s ID number is part of the person&rsquo;s record), so sets are rarely used in practice. Instead, we can simply modify other data structures to enforce the uniqueness property we desire on those attributes. In addition, we see this concept come up again in relational databases, where particular attributes can be assigned a property to enforce the rule that each element must be unique.</p>
<h3 id="linear">Linear</h3>
<p>Linear data refers to data that has a sequence or fixed ordering. This can include</p>
<ul>
<li>a series of characters</li>
<li>a list of steps</li>
<li>a log of actions taken over time</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is typically stored in the <strong>array</strong> or <strong>linked list</strong> data structure, depending on how we intend to use it and what algorithms will be performed on the data.</p>
<p>We can think of this type of data as precisely one after another. This means that from one element there will be exactly one &ldquo;next&rdquo; element.</p>
<p>Finally, we can also adapt these data structures to represent FIFO (first-in, first-out) and LIFO (last-in, first-out) data structures using <strong>queues</strong> and <strong>stacks</strong>. As we saw previously, most implementations of queues and stacks are simply adaptations of existing linear data structures, usually the linked list.</p>
<h3 id="associative">Associative</h3>
<p>Associative data is data where a key is associated with a value, usually in order to quickly find and retrieve the value based on its key. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>student records associated with a student ID</li>
<li>tax forms stored with a social security number</li>
</ul>
<p>We typically use a <strong>hash table</strong> to store this data in our programs.</p>
<p>However, in many cases this data could also be stored in a relational database just as easily, and in most industry programs that may also be a good choice here. Since we haven&rsquo;t yet learned about relational databases, we&rsquo;ll just continue to use hash tables for now.</p>
<h3 id="hierarchical">Hierarchical</h3>
<p>Hierarchical data refers to data where elements can be seen as above, below, or on the same level as other elements. This can include</p>
<ul>
<li>corporate ladders</li>
<li>lineage</li>
<li>file systems</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast to linear data, hierarchical data can have multiple elements following a single element. In hierarchical data, each element has exactly one element prior to it. We typically use some form of a <strong>tree</strong> data structure to store hierarchical data.</p>
<h3 id="relational">Relational</h3>
<p>Relational data refers to data where elements are &lsquo;close to&rsquo; or &lsquo;far from&rsquo; other elements. We can also think of this as &lsquo;more similar&rsquo; and &rsquo;less similar&rsquo; as well. This can include</p>
<ul>
<li>cities</li>
<li>computer components</li>
<li>social media posts</li>
<li>graphics</li>
</ul>
<p>In a relational data set, any element can be &lsquo;related&rsquo; to any other element. We typically use a <strong>graph</strong> data structure to store relational data.</p>
<h3 id="prioritized">Prioritized</h3>
<p>The last type of data we will discuss is prioritized data. Here, we want to store a data element along with a priority, and then be able to quickly retrieve the element with the highest or lowest priority, depending on use. This could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>process switching inside of a computer operating system</li>
<li>delivery tasks to perform</li>
<li>repairs needed on a device</li>
</ul>
<p>For this data, we typically use an implementation of a <strong>priority queue</strong> based on a heap. It is important to remember that the heap does not store the data in sorted order - otherwise we would just use a linear data structure for this. Instead, it guarantees that the next element is always stored at the front of the structure for easy access, and it includes a process to quickly determine the new next element. We&rsquo;ll learn a bit more about why this is so helpful in the next chapter covering performance.</p>

<h1 id="trees">Trees</h1>

<p>In general, trees are good for hierarchical data. While trees can be used for linear data, it is inefficient to implement them in that way (from a certain point of view, a linked list is simply a tree where each node can only have one child). When data points have many predecessors, trees cannot be used. Thus, trees are not suitable for most relational data.</p>
<h3 id="trees">Trees</h3>
<p>To recap, we defined a tree as having the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>There must be a single root,</li>
<li>Each child node has a single parent node,</li>
<li>It must be fully connected (no disjoint parts), and</li>
<li>There can be no cycles (no loops).</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, we used trees to represent family lineage and biologic classifications. Once we have the data in a tree, we can perform both preorder and postorder traversals to see all of the data, and we can use the structure of the tree to determine if two elements are related as ancestor and descendant or not.</p>
<p>We added constraints to trees to give us special types of trees, discussed below.</p>
<h3 id="tries">Tries</h3>
<p>A trie is a type of tree with some special characteristics, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each node contains a single character, with the root node containing an empty character by convention</li>
<li>By starting at the root and traversing parent to children relationships, we can build user-defined words using those characters, and</li>
<li>Each node has a boolean property to indicate if it is the end of a word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tries are best suited for data sets in which elements have similar prefixes. In this course we focused on tries to represent words in a language, which is the most common use of tries. We used tries for an auto-complete style application.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-dc1fc9ce6bac96e9a3fa7da4f4c93b39" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Trie example: words starting with &lsquo;car&rsquo;" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/18/11_trie.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-dc1fc9ce6bac96e9a3fa7da4f4c93b39"><img alt="Trie example: words starting with &lsquo;car&rsquo;" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/18/11_trie.svg"></a></p>
<p>Tries are a very efficient way of storing dense hierarchical data, since each node in the trie only stores a single portion of the overall data. They also allow quickly looking up if a particular element or path exists - usually much quicker than looking through a linear list of words.</p>
<h3 id="binary-trees">Binary Trees</h3>
<p>A binary tree is a type of tree with some special characteristics, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each node has at most 2 children (nodes can have 0, 1, or 2 children), and</li>
<li>unlike general trees, the children in a binary tree are not an unordered set. The children must be ordered such that:
<ul>
<li>all of the descendants in the left tree are less than the parent&rsquo;s value, and</li>
<li>all of the descendants in the right tree are greater than the parent&rsquo;s value</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Binary trees are the ideal structure to use when we have a data set with a well defined ordering. Once we have the data stored in a binary tree, we can also do an inorder traversal, which will access the elements in the tree in sorted order. We will discuss in the next chapter why we might want to choose a binary tree based on its performance.</p>

<h1 id="graphs">Graphs</h1>

<p>Graphs are a good data structure for relational data. This would include data in which elements can have some sort of similarity or distance defined between those elements. This measure of similarity between elements can be defined as realistically or abstractly as needed for the data set. The distance can be as simple as listing neighbors or adjacent elements.</p>
<h3 id="graphs">Graphs</h3>
<p>Graphs are multidimensional data structures that can represent many different types of data using nodes and edges. We can have graphs that are weighted and/or directed and we have introduced two ways we can represent graphs:</p>
<h4 id="matrix-graphs">Matrix Graphs</h4>
<p>The first implementation of graphs that we looked at were matrix graphs. In this implementation, we had an array for the nodes and a two dimensional array for all of the possible edges.</p>
<h4 id="list-graphs">List Graphs</h4>
<p>The second implementation of graphs were list graphs. For this implementation, we had a single array of graph node objects where the graph node objects tracked their own edges.</p>
<p>Recall that we discussed sparse and dense graphs. Matrix graphs are better for dense graphs since a majority of the elements in the two dimensional array of edges will be filled. A great example of a dense graph would be relationships in a small community, where each person is connected to each other person in some way.</p>
<p>List graphs are better for sparse graphs, since each node only needs to store the outgoing edges it is connected to. This eliminates a large amount of the overhead that would be present in a matrix graph if there were thousands of nodes and each node was only connected to a few other nodes. A great example of a sparse graph would be a larger social network such as Facebook. Facebook has over a billion users, but each user has on average only a few hundred connections. So, it is much easier to store a list of those few hundred connections instead of a two dimensional matrix that has over one quintillion ($10^{18}$) elements.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will discuss the specific implications of using one or the other. However, in our requirement analysis it is important to take this into consideration. If we have relational data where many elements are considered to be connected to many other elements, then a matrix graph will be preferred. If the elements of our data set are infrequently connected, then a list graph is the better choice.</p>

<h1 id="priority-queues">Priority Queues</h1>

<p>The last structure we covered were priority queues. On their own, these are good for hierarchical data. We discussed using priority queues for ticketing systems where the priority is the cost or urgency. In the project, we utilized priority queues in conjunction with Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="priority-queues">Priority Queues</h3>
<p>A priority queue is a data structure which contains elements and each element has an associated priority value. The priority for an element corresponds to its importance. For this course, we implemented priority queues using heaps.</p>
<p>A key point of priority queues is that the priority for a value can change. This is reflected by nodes moving up (via push up) or down (via push down) through the priority queue.</p>
<p>In contrast, a tree has a generally fixed order. Consider the file tree as a conceptual example, it is not practical for a parent folder to switch places with a child folder.</p>

<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCa3TreKdqU">YouTube Video</a>

<p>In real world applications, it won&rsquo;t always be a straightforward choice to use one structure over another. Users may come to us with unclear ideas of what they are looking for and we will need to be able to infer what structure is best suited for their needs based on what we can learn from them. Typically, those describing applications to us may not be familiar with the nomenclature we use as programmers. Instead, we have to look for clues about how the data is structured and used to help us choose the most appropriate data structures</p>
<p>Below we have some examples with possible solutions. We say possible solutions because there may be other ways that we could implement things. It is important that no matter what structure or algorithm we use, we should always document why we chose our answer. If someone else were to join on the project at a later time, it is important that they understand our reasoning.</p>
<h3 id="costume-shop">Costume Shop</h3>
<p>A manager at a costume shop has requested that we do some data management for their online catalog. They say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users should be able to refine their search first based on who the costumes are for (adults, children, dogs), then on the part of the costume (tops, bottoms, shoes, props) and then display those options for the user.</li>
<li>I would like if we could recommend costumes to customers based on their searches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a moment to think on how you might go about this. Remember, there can be multiple ways of solving these problems. We need to be sure that we can articulate and justify our answers.</p>
<p>This is a situation where we could potentially use all three data structures!</p>
<p>First, we could use a tree to represent the search refinement. Thinking along the lines of a data structure, each category and subsequently each product will have exactly one parent. While something like &lsquo;wigs&rsquo; shows up in all three categories, you wouldn&rsquo;t want dog wigs showing up in a search for adult wigs. Thus, there is a unique ancestry for each category and product.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-5222a5fadfdee0e27e68a584561b4d05" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Tree for Search" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/18/11_costume_trie.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-5222a5fadfdee0e27e68a584561b4d05"><img alt="Tree for Search" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/18/11_costume_trie.svg"></a></p>
<p>In this scenario we had a fixed ordering of our hierarchy. If the manager wanted users to be able to sort by costume part and then who it was for, our tree would not hold up.</p>
<p>The second portion that was requested was a recommendation system. We could implement this in two parts. The first would be a graph in which the nodes are the products and they are connected based on the similarity of the products.</p>
<p>For example, a purple children&rsquo;s wig will be very similar to a children&rsquo;s blue wig but it would be very different from an adults clown shoes. Thus, our graph would have a heavily weighted connection between the children&rsquo;s purple and blue wig and there would be an edge with a very small weight between the purple wig and adult clown shoes. We can obtain this information from the manager. Since each product will be connected to every other product, a matrix graph would be best suited here.</p>
<p>Then once we have the graph, we could implement a priority queue. The priority queue would be built based off of the users search. When a user searches for a product, we would refer to our graph and get other similar products and enqueue them. The priority would be similarity to the searched products and the item would be the recommended product. As they continue to search, we would dequeue an element if the user selects it and we would change the priority of elements based on commonalities in the searches.</p>
<h3 id="video-game">Video Game</h3>
<p>A friend approaches you about their idea for a video game and ask how they could use different data structures to produce the game. They tell us about their game which is a sandbox game with no defined goals. Users can do tasks at their own chosen speed and there is no real &ldquo;completion&rdquo; of the game. They say:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want users to be able to see the tasks that are available to them and what the payout of the task is. It would be really awesome if we could display around 4 tasks that would earn them the most points.</li>
<li>I have a set of &ldquo;shortcuts&rdquo; that users can use to streamline basic functions like switching tools. It would make sense that all of the shortcuts for switching tools start with the same button clicks. So switching to a shovel would be similar to switching to a hammer.</li>
<li>I have this world in mind that is a lot like our world in terms of terrain and what not. I want players to be able to dig in the dirt and then move that dirt as they like! They could build dirt piles or houses from the trees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a moment to think on how you might go about this. Remember, there can be multiple ways of solving these problems. We need to be sure that we can articulate and justify our answers.</p>
<p>Again, this is a situation where we could potentially use three data structures!</p>
<p>We can use a priority queue to suggest tasks for the players to do. In this priority queue, the priority would be the payout and the item would be the task itself. As tasks get completed, we would dequeue them.</p>
<p>We can use a trie to represent the set of shortcuts. Below is a small sample of how we can implement our trie.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-1a17cdcd876fd7d1c1a92163a6e5bd6a" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Trie for Shortcuts" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/18/11_videogame_trie.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-1a17cdcd876fd7d1c1a92163a6e5bd6a"><img alt="Trie for Shortcuts" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/18/11_videogame_trie.svg"></a></p>
<p>Since our friend mentioned that similar tasks should have similar combinations, a trie will fit well. These key combinations will have similar prefixes, so we can save ourselves space to store them by using a trie.</p>
<p>Finally, for the world layout we could use a graph. Similar to the maze project or weather station project, we can have nodes represent points on a plot and the edges will represent connections. The nodes will now have three coordinates, (x,y,z), rather than two, (x,y) or (latitude, longitude) and they will have an associated type (dirt, tree, rock, etc.).</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-80cb47863beb4a759f71dcc0ef455c8d" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Graph for world blocks" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/18/11_videogame_graph.svg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-80cb47863beb4a759f71dcc0ef455c8d"><img alt="Graph for world blocks" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/18/11_videogame_graph.svg"></a></p>
<p>Two nodes will be connected if they directly adjacent. Players can harvest cubes such as soil or limestone, and it would be removed from the world. We would utilize our remove node function to reflect this kind of action. Similarly, players can build up the world in spaces that allow, such as the dirt pile in an open area, and for that we can use our add node function as well as the appropriate add edge functions.</p>
<p>In our implementation of a graph, it would be better to use a list graph. Each block will be connected to at most six other blocks.</p>
