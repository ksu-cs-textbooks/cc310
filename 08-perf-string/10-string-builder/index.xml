    <title>String Builder :: CC 310 Textbook</title>

    <description>Note This video was created as part of another course. We have moved this content into CC 310 as a great example of a data structure that exists purely for performance reasons&#xA;YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;In CC 310 we covered various data structures: stacks, sets, lists, queues, and hash tables. When we looked at these structures, we considered how to access elements within the structures, how we would create our own implementation of the structure, and tasks that these structures would be fitting for as well as ill fitting.</description>
