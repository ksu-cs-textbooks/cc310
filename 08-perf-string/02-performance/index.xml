    <title>Data Structure Performance :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/08-perf-string/02-performance/</link>
    <description>Data structures that are used in our programs can be characterized in terms of two performance attributes: processing time and memory usage.&#xA;We will not worry about memory usage at this point, since most of the memory used in these data structures is consumed by the data that we are storing. More technically, we would say that the memory use of a data structure containing N elements is on the order of $N$ size.</description>
