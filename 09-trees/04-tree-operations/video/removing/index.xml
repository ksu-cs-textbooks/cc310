    <title>Removing Child :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/09-trees/04-tree-operations/video/removing/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script [Slide 1]&#xA;For full functionality of our tree, we need to be able to remove children as well as add them. Thinking of the example of a file tree, if we were to delete a file, that would remove it from our tree. In most cases, deleting a file just removes it from the current directory and into a trash or recycle folder. Meaning it is not removed from existence.</description>
