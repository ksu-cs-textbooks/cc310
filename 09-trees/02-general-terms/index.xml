    <description>YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;To get ourselves comfortable in working with trees, we will outline some standard vocabulary. Throughout this section, we will use the following tree as a guiding example for visualizing the definitions.&#xA;Definitions Node - the general term for a structure which contains an item, such as a character or even another data structure. Edge - the connection between two nodes. In a tree, the edge will be pointing in a downward direction.</description>
