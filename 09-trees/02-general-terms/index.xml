    <description>Warning The video incorrectly states the degree of a tree is equal to the degree of the root. The correct definition is that the degree of a tree is the largest degree of any node in the tree.&#xA;YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;To get ourselves comfortable in working with trees, we will outline some standard vocabulary. Throughout this section, we will use the following tree as a guiding example for visualizing the definitions.</description>
