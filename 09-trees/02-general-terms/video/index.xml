    <title>Tree Terms :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/09-trees/02-general-terms/video/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script [Slide 1]&#xA;To be able to work with tree and really understand them, we will start with some vocabulary. We will use this tree as a guiding example for the terms. The first that we will cover are nodes and edges.&#xA;[Slide 2]&#xA;Nodes, which we depict visually as circles, are the structures which contain the data. Here we have outlined them in a dashed line to emphasize them.</description>
