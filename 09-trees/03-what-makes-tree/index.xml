    <title>What Makes a Tree a Tree :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/09-trees/03-what-makes-tree/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;Trees can come in many shapes and sizes. There are, however some constraints to making a valid tree.&#xA;A tree has a single root A child has exactly one parent A tree is fully connected (IE a single tree) A tree has no cycles (IE no loops) Valid Trees Any combination of the following represents a valid tree:&#xA;A tree with a single node; just a root, A tree where each node has a single child, or A tree where nodes have many children.</description>
