    <title>Trie Example :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/09-trees/old/2-trie-example/</link>
    <description>Let’s look at another example of a trie. Here we have a larger trie. Think about how many words are captured by the tree; click the tree to see how many! This tree contains 12 words: ‘ate’, ‘an’, ‘and’, ‘ant’, ‘app’, ‘apple’, ‘cat’, ‘can’, ‘cup’, ‘by’, ‘be’, and ‘been’. While the ‘a’, ‘at’, and ‘bee’ are words in the English language, they are not recognized by our trie. Depending on what the user intended, this could be by design.</description>
