    <description>As you might guess from its name, object-oriented programming languages are made to create and manipulate entities called objects. But what exactly are these objects? Objects were created to help decompose large complex programs with a lot of complex data into manageable parts.&#xA;Object An object is a programming entity that contains related data and behavior.&#xA;A good example of an object is dog. But not just any dog, or all dogs, but a specific dog.</description>
