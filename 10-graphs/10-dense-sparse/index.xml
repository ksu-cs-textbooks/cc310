    <title>Dense VS Sparse :: CC 310 Textbook</title>

    <description>When considering which implementation to use, we need to consider the connectivity in our graph. The terms that we use to describe the connectedness are dense and sparse.&#xA;Dense Graph: A dense graph is a graph in which there is a large number of edges. Typically in a dense graph, the number of edges is close to the maximum number of edges. Sparse Graph: A sparse graph is a graph in which there is a small number of edges.</description>
