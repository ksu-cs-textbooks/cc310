    <title>List Representation :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/10-graphs/09-list/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video In the matrix representation, we had an array of the node items. In the list representation, we will have an array of node objects. Each node object will keep track of the node item, the node index, and the outgoing edges.&#xA;The item can be any object and the index will be a value within our capacity. The edges will be a list of pairs where the first entry is the index of the target node and the second entry is the weight of the edge.</description>
