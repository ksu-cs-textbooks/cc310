    <title>Choosing an Algorithm :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc310/12-performance/8-choosing-an-algorithm/</link>
    <description>There are many different algorithms we can use to sort our data, and some of them can be shown mathematically to be more efficient, even in the worst case. So, how should we choose which algorithm to use?&#xA;In practice, it really comes down to a variety of factors, based on the amount of data we expect our program to handle, the randomness of the data, and more. The only way to truly know which algorithm is the best is to empirically test all of them and choose the fastest one, but even that approach relies on us predicting the data that our program will be utilizing.</description>
