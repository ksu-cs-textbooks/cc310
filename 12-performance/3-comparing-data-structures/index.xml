    <title>Comparing Data Structures :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc310/12-performance/3-comparing-data-structures/</link>
    <description>One of the best ways to compare data structures is to look at the common operations that they can perform. For this analysis, we’ve chosen to analyze the following four operations:&#xA;Insert – inserting a specific element into the structure, either in sorted order, or at the appropriate place as required by the definition of a stack or queue. Access – accessing a desired element. For general data structures, this is the process of accessing an element by its index or key in the structure.</description>
