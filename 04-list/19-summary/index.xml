    <description>In this module we looked at the stack data structure. Stacks are a “last in first out” data structure that use two main operations, push and pop, to put data onto the stack and to remove data off of the stack. Stacks are useful in many applications including text editor “undo” and web browser “back” functions.&#xA;We also saw the queue data structure. Queues are a “first in first out” data structure that use two main operations, enqueue and dequeue, to put data into the queue and to remove data from the queue.</description>
