    <title>Basic Operations :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/04-list/old/04-stack-operations/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video We have already seen two basic stack operations: push and pop. However, there are others that make the stack much easier to use. These basic operations are:&#xA;push: places an item on top of the stack, pop: removes the item on the top of the stack and returns it, peek: returns the item on the top of the stack without removing it from the stack, isEmpty: returns true if there are no items on the stack, and isFull: returns true if our stack array is full.</description>
