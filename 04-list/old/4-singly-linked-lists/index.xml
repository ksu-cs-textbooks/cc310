    <description>YouTube Video Linked Node To solve the disadvantages of arrays, we need a data structure that allows us to insert and remove items in an ordered collection in constant time, independently from the number of items in the data structure.&#xA;The solution lies in creating our own specialized data structure where each node contains the data of interest as well as a reference, or pointer to the next node in the list.</description>
