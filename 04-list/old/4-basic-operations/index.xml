    <description>YouTube Video We have already seen the pseudocode for the two key operations for queues: enqueue and dequeue. However, there are several others that make the queue data structure much easier to use:&#xA;enqueue—places an item on the end of the queue, dequeue—removes and returns the item at the start of the queue, peek—returns the item at the start of the queue without removing it, isEmpty—returns true if there are no items in the queue, isFull—returns true if our queue array is full, and size—returns the number of items in the queue.</description>
