    <title>Doubly Linked Lists - Removal and Peek :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/04-list/old/11-doubly-linked-lists---removal-and-peek/</link>
    <description>The process of removing a node from a doubly linked list is really no more difficult than from a singly linked list. The only difference is that instead of changing just one pointer, we now also need to modify the previous pointer in the node following the node we want to remove. For instance, if we want to remove node “3” from the following list,&#xA;we simply modify the next pointer in node “-2” to point to node “23”.</description>
