    <title>Doubly Linked Lists - Insertion :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/04-list/old/10-doubly-linked-lists---insertion/</link>
    <description>Insertion in doubly linked lists is similar to what we saw in the singly linked list with two exceptions:&#xA;We must update both the previous and next pointers in all affected nodes. We can use the tail pointer to make the insertion of data at the end of the list very efficient. Inserting at the Beginning Inserting at the beginning of a doubly linked list is almost as straightforward as in a singly linked list.</description>
