    <title>List-Based Queues :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/04-list/18-list-queue/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Implementing a queue with a doubly linked list is straightforward and efficient. The core queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, isEmpty, and peek) can all be implemented by directly calling list operations that run in constant time. The only other major operation is the toString operation, which is also implemented by directly calling the list toString operation; however, it runs in order $N$ time due to the fact that the list toString operation must iterate through each item in the list.</description>
