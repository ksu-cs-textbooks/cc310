<p>Most of us see and use lists every day. We have a list for shopping as we saw above, but we may also have a &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list, a list of homework assignments, or a list of movies we want to watch. Some of us are list-makers and some are not, but we all know a list when we see it.</p>

<p>However, there are other lists in the real world that we might not even think of as a list. For instance, a playlist on our favorite music app is an example of a list. A music app lets us move forward or backward in a list or choose a song randomly from a list. We can even reorder our list whenever we want.</p>
<p>All the examples we&rsquo;ve seen for stacks and queues can be thought of as lists as well. Stacks of chairs or moving boxes, railroad trains, and cars going through a tollbooth are all examples of special types of lists.</p>
