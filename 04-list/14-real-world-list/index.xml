    <title>Lists in the Real World :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/04-list/14-real-world-list/</link>
    <description>Most of us see and use lists every day. We have a list for shopping as we saw above, but we may also have a “to do” list, a list of homework assignments, or a list of movies we want to watch. Some of us are list-makers and some are not, but we all know a list when we see it.&#xA;1&#xA;However, there are other lists in the real world that we might not even think of as a list.</description>
