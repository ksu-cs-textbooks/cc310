    <title>Stack Operations :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/04-list/04-stack-operations/</link>
    <description>The following table shows an example of how to use the above operations to create and manipulate a stack. It assumes the steps are performed sequentially and the result of the operation is shown.&#xA;Step Operation Effect 1 Constructor Creates an empty stack. 2 isFull() Returns false since top is not equal to the capacity of the stack. 3 isEmpty() Returns true since top is equal to -1 4 push(1) Increments top by 1 and then places item $1$ onto the top of the stack 5 push(2) Increments top by 1 and then places item $2$ onto the top of the stack 6 push(3) Increments top by 1 and then places item $3$ onto the top of the stack 7 peek() Returns the item $3$ on the top of the stack but does not remove the item from the stack.</description>
