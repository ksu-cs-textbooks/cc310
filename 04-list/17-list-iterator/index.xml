    <title>List Iterators :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/04-list/17-list-iterator/</link>
    <description>Note You will not be asked to implement a list iterator, but it is an interesting concept to study. Most languages that have a foreach loop construct use iterators behind the scenes to keep track of the current position in the list. This is also why you should not modify the structure of the list while iterating through it using a foreach loop.&#xA;YouTube Video An iterator is a set of operations a data structure provides to allow users to access the items in the data structure sequentially, without requiring them to know its underlying representation.</description>
