    <title>Queues in the Real World :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/04-list/08-real-world-queue/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video The name for queues comes the word in British English used to describe a line of people. Instead of forming lines to wait for some service, British form queues. Thus, when we think of queues, often the first picture to come to mind is a group of people standing in a line. Of course, this is exactly how a computer queue operates as well. The first person in line gets served first.</description>
