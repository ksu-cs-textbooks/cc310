    <title>Using a Queue :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/04-list/11-using-queue/</link>
    <description>Queues are useful in many applications. Classic real-world software which uses queues includes the scheduling of tasks, sharing of resources, and processing of messages in the proper order. A common need is to schedule tasks to be executed based on their priority. This type of scheduling can be done in a computer or on an assembly line floor, but the basic concept is the same.&#xA;Letâ€™s assume that we are putting windshields onto new cars in a production line.</description>
