    <description>YouTube Video Video Slides&#xA;A good application of priority queues is finding the shortest path in a graph. A common algorithm for this is Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.&#xA;Edsger Dijkstra was a Dutch computer scientist who researched many fields. He is credited for his work in physics, programming, software engineering, and as a systems scientist. His motivation for this algorithm in particular was to be able to find the shortest path between two cities.</description>
