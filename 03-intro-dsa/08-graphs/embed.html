<p>The most general version of a non-linear data structure is the <em>graph</em>, as shown in the diagram above. A graph is a set of <em>nodes</em> that contain data, as well as a set of <em>edges</em> that link two nodes together. Edges themselves may also contain data.</p>
<p>Graphs are great for storing and visualizing not just data, but also the relationships between data. For example, each node in the graph could represent a city on the map, with the edges representing the travel time between the two cities. Or we could use the nodes in a graph to represent the people in a social network, and the edges represent connections or friendships between two people. There are many possibilities!</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-a-graph">When to Use a Graph</h2>
<p>Graphs are a great choice when we need to store data and relationships between the data, but we aren&rsquo;t sure exactly what structures or limitations are present in the data. Since a graph is the most general and flexible non-linear data type, it has the most ability to represent data in a wide variety of ways.</p>
