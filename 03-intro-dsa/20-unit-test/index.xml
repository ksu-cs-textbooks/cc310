    <description>Once we’ve written a program, how can we verify that it works correctly? There are many ways to do this, but one of the most common is unit testing.&#xA;Unit Testing Unit testing a program involves writing code that actually runs the program and verifies that it works correctly. In addition, many unit tests will also check that the program produces appropriate errors when given bad input, or even that it won’t crash when given invalid input.</description>
