    <description>1&#xA;The other major topic covered in this course is the use of algorithms to manipulate the data stored in our data structures.&#xA;An algorithm is best defined as a finite list of specific instructions for performing a task. In the real world, we see algorithms all the time. A recipe for cooking your favorite dish, instructions for how to fix a broken car, or a method for solving a complex mathematical equation can all be considered examples of an algorithm.</description>
