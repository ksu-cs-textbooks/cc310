    <title>Recursion :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/03-intro-dsa/15-recursion/</link>
    <description>The next algorithmic technique we’ll discuss is recursion. Recursion is closely related to the divide and conquer method we discussed earlier. However, recursion itself is a very complicated term to understand. It usually presents one of the most difficult challenges for a novice programmer to overcome when learning to write more advanced programs. Don’t worry! We’ll spend an entire module on recursion later in this course.&#xA;What is Recursion? There are many different ways to define recursion.</description>
