    <description>YouTube Video First, we can broadly separate the data structures we’re going to learn about into two types, linear and non-linear data structures.&#xA;A linear data structure typically stores data in a single dimension, just like an array. By using a linear data structure, we would know that a particular element in the data structure comes before another element or vice-versa, but that’s about it. A great example is seen in the image above.</description>
