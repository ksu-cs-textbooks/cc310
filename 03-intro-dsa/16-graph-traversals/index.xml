    <title>Graph Traversal :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/03-intro-dsa/16-graph-traversals/</link>
    <description>Beyond the algorithmic techniques we’ve introduced so far, there are a number of techniques that deal specifically with data stored in non-linear data structures based on graphs. Generally speaking, we can group all of these algorithms under the heading graph traversal algorithms.&#xA;A graph traversal algorithm constructs an answer to a problem by moving between nodes in a graph using the graph’s edges, thereby traversing the graph. For example, a graph traversal algorithm could be used by a mapping program to construct a route from one city to another on a map, or to determine friends in common on a social networking website.</description>
