    <title>Postconditions :: CC 310 Textbook</title>

    <description>Next, we can discuss postconditions. A postcondition is a statement that is guaranteed to be true after a method is executed, provided all of the preconditions were met. If any one of the preconditions were not met, then we canâ€™t count on the postcondition being true either. This is the most important concept surrounding preconditions and postconditions.&#xA;Info If the preconditions of a method are all true when a method is called, then we may assume the postconditions are true after the method is complete, provided it is written correctly.</description>
