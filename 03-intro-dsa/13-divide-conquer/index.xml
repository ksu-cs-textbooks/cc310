    <title>Divide and Conquer :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/03-intro-dsa/13-divide-conquer/</link>
    <description>The next most common algorithmic technique is divide and conquer. A divide and conquer algorithm works just like it sounds. First, it will divide the problem into at least two or more smaller problems, and then it will try to solve each of those problems individually. It might even try to subdivide those smaller problems again and again to finally get to a small enough problem that it is easy to solve.</description>
