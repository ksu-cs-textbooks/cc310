    <description>The last of the linear data structures may seem linear from the outside, but inside it can be quite a bit more complex.&#xA;The map data structure is an example of a key-value data structure, also known as a dictionary or associative array. In the simplest case, a map data structure keeps track of a key that uniquely identifies a particular value, and stores that value along with the key in the data structure.</description>
