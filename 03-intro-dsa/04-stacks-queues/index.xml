    <description>The next two data structures weâ€™ll look at are stacks and queues. They are both very similar to lists in most respects, but each one puts a specific limitation on how the data structure operates that make them very useful in certain situations.&#xA;Stack 1&#xA;A stack is one special version of a list. Specifically, a stack is a Last In, First Out or LIFO data structure.&#xA;So, what does that mean?</description>
