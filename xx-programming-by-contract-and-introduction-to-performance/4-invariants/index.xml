    <description>Another concept related to preconditions and postconditions is the loop invariant. A loop invariant is a statement should be true after each iteration of a loop, provided the loop’s preconditions are all true before the start of the loop. Yes, that’s right—we can think of a loop as a miniature method within a method, with its own set of preconditions and postconditions.&#xA;Example - Maximum For this example, let’s consider a method maximum(numbers) that gets an array of numbers as input, and returns the maximum value stored in that list.</description>
