    <description>We can also look at a program based on the amount of space, or memory, that it uses. In this case, we are looking at the number of variables that are needed, and also the size of any lists, arrays, or more advanced data structures used.&#xA;The comparison in terms of space leads us to observe that the linear solution uses, in addition to the input value x for each iteration of the loop, also the max and min variables.</description>
