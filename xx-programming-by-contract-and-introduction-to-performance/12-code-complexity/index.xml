    <description>Lastly, when analyzing a program, we must also consider the complexity of the code used to write the program. Code complexity can refer to many things, but in general we use it to describe how many lines of code are included the program, as well as how easy it is to understand what the program does.&#xA;Lines of Code One of the most common ways to measure the size of a program is the number of lines of code, or LOC, of the program.</description>
