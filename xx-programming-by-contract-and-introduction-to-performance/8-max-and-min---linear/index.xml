    <description>YouTube Video Letâ€™s start by considering one number from the list at a time.&#xA;Base Case When we have received just one number, this number is both the maximum and the minimum. In the initial state, you have max holding the maximum, and min holding the minimum. The invariant is the following:&#xA;The variable max holds the maximum of all the numbers considered so far The variable min holds the minimum of all the numbers considered so far The algorithm is depicted by the following flowchart and pseudocode:</description>
