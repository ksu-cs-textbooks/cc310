    <title>Programming by Contract and Performance Summary :: CC 310 Textbook</title>

    <description>In this module, we covered two major topics that will help us understand the data structures and algorithms we’ll learn in this course. First, we learned about the use of preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants to help describe the exact specifications of how methods and loops should operate in code. We’ll use these as the basis of unit tests in this course to help prove the correctness of data structures and algorithms we are asked to develop throughout the course.</description>
