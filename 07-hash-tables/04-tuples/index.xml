    <title>Tuples :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/07-hash-tables/04-tuples/</link>
    <description>Before we can start describing the basic hash table functions, we first need to create a way to handle key-value pairs. We generally refer to any piece of data that has two parts as a tuple. In the case of key-value pairs, our tuple would look like (key, value). Some languages, such as Python, provide built-in support for creating tuples, while others such as Java and C# require us to create our own tuple class, which is easy to do.</description>
