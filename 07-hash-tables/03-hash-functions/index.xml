    <title>Hash Functions :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/07-hash-tables/03-hash-functions/</link>
    <description>A hash function converts a key into a hash code, which is an integer value that can be used to index our hash table array. Obviously, there are some hash functions that are better than others. Specifically, a good hash function is both easy to compute and should uniformly distribute the keys across our hash table array. Both of these are important factors in how fast our hash table operates, since we compute a hash code each time we insert or get a key-value pair from the hash table.</description>
