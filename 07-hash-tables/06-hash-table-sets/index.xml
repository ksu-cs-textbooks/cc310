    <description>YouTube Video In this section, we walk through the pseudocode for some basic set operations built on our hash table class above. In this new version of the set class, we declare mySet as a hash table and use that throughout our operations.&#xA;mySet = new HashTable() When using a hash table to implement sets, one of the most important choices we must make is what to use for a key.</description>
