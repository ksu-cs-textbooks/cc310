    <description>The performance of our algorithms is very important, since the difference between good algorithms and bad algorithms on very large data sets can often be measured in terms of days of execution time. Thus, efficiency will be one of the key issues we will look at when designing algorithms.&#xA;For example, one simple problem involves finding the largest sum of contiguous elements in an array. So, if we have the array:</description>
