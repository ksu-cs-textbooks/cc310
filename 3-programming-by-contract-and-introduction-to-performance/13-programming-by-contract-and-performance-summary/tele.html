<p>In this module, we covered two major topics that will help us understand the data structures and algorithms we&rsquo;ll learn in this course. First, we learned about the use of <em>preconditions</em>, <em>postconditions</em>, and <em>loop invariants</em> to help describe the exact specifications of how methods and loops should operate in code. We&rsquo;ll use these as the basis of <em>unit tests</em> in this course to help prove the <em>correctness</em> of data structures and algorithms we are asked to develop throughout the course.</p>
<p>In addition, we were introduced to the concepts of <em>time complexity</em>, <em>space complexity</em>, and <em>code complexity</em>, three ways to measure the performance and usefulness of a computer program. We also learned that it may be difficult to find a perfect program that has very little time, space, and code complexity, so many times we&rsquo;ll have to consider a trade-off between programs that operate quickly, use less memory, and are easier to understand.</p>
<p>Which these tools, we&rsquo;re in a much better place to understand the specifics of the data structures and algorithms we&rsquo;ll encounter in this module. Next, we&rsquo;ll do a short project to explore how we can build programs based on a set of preconditions, postconditions, and invariants instead of the plain language descriptions we&rsquo;ve used up to this point.</p>
