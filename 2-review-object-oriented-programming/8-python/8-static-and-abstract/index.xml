    <description>Static Many programming languages include a special keyword static. In essence, a static attribute or method is part of the class in which it is declared instead of part of objects instantiated from that class. If we think about it, the word static means “lacking in change”, and that’s sort of a good way to think about it.&#xA;In a UML diagram, static attributes and methods are denoted by underlining them.</description>
