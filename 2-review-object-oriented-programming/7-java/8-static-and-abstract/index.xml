    <description>The other important modifier we can use in Java is the static modifier. Again, we’ve seen this modifier each time we declare the main method in our programs, but we haven’t really been able to discuss exactly what it means. Thankfully, we now have the knowledge we need to talk about the static modifier.&#xA;In essence, the static modifier makes an attribute or method part of the class in which it is declared instead of part of objects instantiated from that class.</description>
