    <title>What are Sets? :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/xx-sets/1-what-are-sets-/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video A set is a collection of elements that are usually related to each other. They can be sets of numbers, letters, people, cars, or even sets themselves! Thus, the elements stored in a stack, queue or list can all be considered as sets. When we define the elements in a set, we typically enclose them in curly brackets as follows.&#xA;$$&#xD;\text{A} = \{ \text{Emily}, \text{Don}, \text{Mohammed}, \text{Huichen} \}&#xD;$$ Here, $\text{A}$ is the name of the set and Emily, Don, Mohammed, and Huichen are members of set $\text{A}$.</description>
