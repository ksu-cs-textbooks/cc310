    <title>Sets Summary :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/xx-sets/6-sets-summary/</link>
    <description>In this module, we introduced a new data structure, the Set. A set is a collection of values that does not contain any duplicate items. For simplicity, we showed an implementation of a set using a doubly linked list, but we could easily use an array to store a set as well.&#xA;Sets also include several unique operations, such as union, intersection, and difference. We looked at the pseudocode for some of these operations, but a few of them are left as exercises for us to complete in the project for this module.</description>
