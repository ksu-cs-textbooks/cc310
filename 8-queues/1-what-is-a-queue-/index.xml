    <title>What is a Queue? :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc310/8-queues/1-what-is-a-queue-/</link>
    <description>A queue (pronounced like the letter “q”) data structure organizes data in a First In, First Out (FIFO) order: the first piece of data put into the queue is the first piece of data available to remove from the queue. A queue functions just like the line you would get into to go into a ballgame, movie, or concert: the person that arrives first is the first to get into the venue.</description>
