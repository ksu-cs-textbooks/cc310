<p>In this module, we introduced a new data structure, the Set. A set is a collection of values that does not contain any duplicate items. For simplicity, we showed an implementation of a set using a doubly linked list, but we could easily use an array to store a set as well.</p>
<p>Sets also include several unique operations, such as union, intersection, and difference. We looked at the pseudocode for some of these operations, but a few of them are left as exercises for us to complete in the project for this module.</p>
<p>While we rarely use sets in practice, the concepts we learned are instrumental in the development of more complex data storage techniques such as relational databases.</p>
