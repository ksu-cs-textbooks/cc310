    <title>Operations on Sets :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc310/10-sets/2-operations-on-sets/</link>
    <description>Now that we can create and show sets of various types of elements, there are a few interesting operations that we can perform on sets. Given two sets, $\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$, we can perform the following operations:&#xA;Union $\cup$ — a set with all the elements from both sets, Intersection $\cap$ — a set with only elements that are in both sets, Difference $\setminus$ — a set with the elements in one set that are not in the other, Disjoint $\text{A} \cap \text{B} = \emptyset$ — two sets don’t share any elements in common Subset $\subseteq$ — one set is completely contained in another set Superset $\supseteq$ — one set completely contains another set Product $\times$ — a set of all the ordered pairs where the first element is from the first set and second element is from the second set, and Powerset $\wp$ — a set of all the subsets of a given set.</description>
