    <title>Set Operations :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/10-sets/4-set-operations/</link>
    <description>In this section, we will walk through the pseudocode for some basic set operations. We will build our set class using the doubly linked list class. In this way, we can build from the functionality that is already developed. So, in the set class, we will declare mySet as a doubly linked list and use that throughout our operations.&#xA;mySet = new doubleLinkedList()Contains The first operation we will look at is the contains operation, which checks to see if a given object already exists in our set.</description>
