    <description>YouTube Video In this module, we will discuss how we can determine which data structure we should choose when storing real-world data. We’ll typically make this decision based on the characteristics of the data we would like to store. In general, the data structures we’ve learned often work together well and complement each other, as we saw in Dijkstra’s algorithm. In some cases, one structure can be utilized to implement another, such as using a linked list to implement a stack or a queue.</description>
