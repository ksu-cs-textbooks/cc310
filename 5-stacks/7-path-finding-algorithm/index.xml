    <title>Path Finding Algorithm :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc310/5-stacks/7-path-finding-algorithm/</link>
    <description>The pseudocode for finding the initial path using the stack is shown below. We assume the enclosing class has already defined a stack called myStack and the datatype called Cell, which represents the squares in the maze. The algorithm also uses three helper functions as described below:&#xA;getNextCell(maze, topCell): computes the next cell based on our current cell’s location and direction; incrementDirection(topCell): increments a cell’s direction attribute following the clockwise sequence of up, right, down, left, and then finally done, which means that we’ve tried all directions; and valid(nextCell): determines if a cell is valid.</description>
