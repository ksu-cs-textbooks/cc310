    <title>Stacks in the Real World :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/5-stacks/2-stacks-in-the-real-world/</link>
    <description>So, where do we see stacks in the real world? A great example is repairing an automobile. It is much easier to put a car back together if we put the pieces back on in the reverse order we took them off. Thus, as we take parts off a car, it is highly recommended that we lay them out in a line. Then, when we are ready to put things back together, we can just start at the last piece we took off and work our way back.</description>
