    <title>Searching &amp; Sorting Summary :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/06-search-sort/27-summary/</link>
    <description>In this chapter, we learned how to search for values in an array using a linear search method. Then, we explored four different sorting algorithms, and compared them based on their time complexity. Finally, we learned how we can use a sorted array to perform a faster binary search and saw how we can increase our performance by sorting our array before searching in certain situations.&#xA;Searching and sorting are two of the most common operations performed in computer programs, and it is very important to have a deep understanding of how they work.</description>
