    <description>In this course, we are learning about many different ways we can store data in our programs, using arrays, queues, stacks, lists, maps, and more. We’ve already covered a few of these data structures, and we’ll learn about the others in upcoming modules. Before we get there, we should also look at a couple of the most important operations we can perform on those data structures.&#xA;Consider the classic example of a data structure containing information about students in a school.</description>
