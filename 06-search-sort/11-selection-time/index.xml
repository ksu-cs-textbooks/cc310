    <title>Selection Sort Time Complexity :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/06-search-sort/11-selection-time/</link>
    <description>Letâ€™s look at the time complexity of the selection sort algorithm, just so we can get a feel for how much time this operation takes.&#xA;First, we must determine if there is a worst-case input for selection sort. Can we think of any particular input which would require more steps to complete?&#xA;In this case, each iteration of selection sort will look at the same number of elements, no matter what they are.</description>
