    <title>Merge Sort :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/06-search-sort/15-merge/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Another commonly used sorting algorithm is merge sort. Merge sort uses a recursive, divide and conquer approach to sorting, which makes it very powerful. It was actually developed to handle sorting data sets that were so large that they couldnâ€™t fit on a single memory device, way back in the early days of computing.&#xA;The basic idea of the merge sort algorithm is as follows:&#xA;If the container only contains one or two elements, we can quickly sort that container by swapping the elements if needed.</description>
