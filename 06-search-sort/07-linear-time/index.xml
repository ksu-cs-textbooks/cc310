    <title>Linear Search Time Complexity :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/06-search-sort/07-linear-time/</link>
    <description>Weâ€™ve examined many different versions of a linear search algorithm. We can find the first occurrence of a number in an array, the last occurrence of that number, or a value with a particular property, such as the minimum value. Each of these are examples of a linear search, since we look at each element in the container sequentially until we find what we are looking for.&#xA;So, what would be the time complexity of this process?</description>
