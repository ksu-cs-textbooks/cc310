    <title>Bubble Sort Time Complexity :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/06-search-sort/14-bubble-time/</link>
    <description>Once again, let’s look at the time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm and see how it compares to selection sort.&#xA;Bubble sort is a bit trickier to analyze than selection sort, because there are really two parts to the algorithm:&#xA;The number of comparisons, and The number of swaps. Let’s look at each one individually. First, is there a way to reduce the number of comparisons made by this algorithm just by changing the input?</description>
