    <description>YouTube Video The conditional statement, also known as the If-Then statement, is used to control the programâ€™s flow by checking the value of a Boolean statement and determining if a block of code should be executed based on that value. This is the simplest conditional instruction. If the condition is true, the block enclosed within the statement is executed. If it is false, then the code in the block is skipped.</description>
