    <description>At this point, we’ve covered enough material to build a simple program. So, let’s see if we can complete the following example program before continuing.&#xA;Problem Statement Write a program that reads an integer from either the terminal, or a file if one is provided as a command-line argument. It should not worry about handling any exceptions encountered.&#xA;The program should compute and print the sum of all integers from 1 up to and including the integer provided as input, except those integers which are evenly divisible by 3.</description>
