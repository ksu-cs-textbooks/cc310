<h1 id="style">Style</h1>

<p>To make your code easier to read, many textbooks and companies use a <em>style guide</em> that defines some of the formating rules that you should follow in your source code. However, this is a point of contention, and many folks disagree over what is the best format. These formatting rules do not affect the actual code itself, only how easy it is to read.</p>
<p>For this book, most of the examples will be presented in a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#K&R_style" rel="external" target="_blank">K&amp;R Style</a> used by most Java developers, which places the opening brace on the same line as the declaration, but the closing brace is placed on a line by itself and indented at the same level as the declaration. The code inside will be indented by four spaces.</p>
<p>Google provides a comprehensive <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html" rel="external" target="_blank">style guide</a> that is recommended reading if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about how to format your source code.</p>

<p>Codio also includes a special assessment that will validate the coding style of your code based on the Google style guide. Use the assessment below to make sure your solution to Exercise 1 meets the expected coding style standard.</p>
<p>&ndash;removed&ndash;</p>
<p>We will also be enforcing this style on many projects and assignments in this class, so it is very important to become familiar with proper coding style!</p>
