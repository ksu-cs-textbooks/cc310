    <description>It is important both to easily grasp the design choice and the code structure of a project even long after it has been completed. The documentation process starts by commenting the code. Code comments are usually intended for software developers and aim at clarifying the code by giving details of how it works. They are usually performed using inline or multiple lines comments using the language syntax.&#xA;Single Line Comments As weâ€™ve seen before, we can add single-line comments to our Python programs using a hash symbol # before a line in our source file:</description>
