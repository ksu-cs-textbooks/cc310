    <description>Programming 1&#xA;Programming is the act of writing source code for a computer program in such a way that a modern computer can understand and perform the steps described in the code. There are many different programming languages that can be used, such as high-level languages like Java and Python.&#xA;To run code written in those languages, we can use a compiler to convert the code to a low-level language that can be directly executed by the computer, or we can use an interpreter to read the code and perform the requested operations on the computer.</description>
