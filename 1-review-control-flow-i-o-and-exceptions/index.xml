      <description>Programming ^[https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1172040]
Programming is the act of writing source code for a computer program in such a way that a modern computer can understand and perform the steps described in the code. There are many different programming languages that can be used, such as high-level languages like Java and Python.
To run code written in those languages, we can use a compiler to convert the code to a low-level language that can be directly executed by the computer, or we can use an interpreter to read the code and perform the requested operations on the computer.</description>

      <description>In this course, we will primarily be learning different ways to store and manipulate data in our programs. Of course, we could do this using the source code of our chosen programming language, but in many cases that would defeat the purpose of learning how to do it ourselves!
Instead, we will use several different ways to represent the steps required to build our programs. Let&amp;rsquo;s review a couple of them now.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s a quick overview of the basics we&amp;rsquo;ll need to know before starting the new content in this course. The next module will provide a quick review of object-oriented programming concepts as well as the model-view-controller or MVC architecture, both of which will be used heavily in this course.</description>
