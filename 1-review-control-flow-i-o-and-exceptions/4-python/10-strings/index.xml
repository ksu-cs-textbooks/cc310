    <description>Strings are another very important data type in programming. A string is simply a set of characters that represent text in our programs. We can then write programs that use and manipulate strings in a variety of ways, allowing us to easily work with textual data.&#xA;Strings in Flowcharts &amp; Pseudocode The table below lists the flowchart blocks used to represent strings, as well as the corresponding pseudocode:&#xA;Operation Flowchart Pseudocode Create String STR = “abc” Access Character C = STR[0] String Length X = size of STR Strings in Python Let’s review the syntax for working with strings in Python.</description>
