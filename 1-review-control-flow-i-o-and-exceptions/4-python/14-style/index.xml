    <description>Style Guide To make your code easier to read, many textbooks and companies use a style guide that defines some of the formating rules that you should follow in your source code. In Python, these rules are very important, as the structure of your code is defined by the layout. Weâ€™ll learn more about that in a later module.&#xA;For this book, most of the examples will be presented using the guidelines in the Style Guide for Python.</description>
