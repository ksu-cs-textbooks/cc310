      <title>Introducing Recursion</title>

      <description>We are now used to using functions in our programs that allow us to decompose complex problems into smaller problems that are easier to solve. Now, we will look at a slight wrinkle in how we use functions. Instead of simply having functions call other functions, we now allow for the fact that a function can actually call itself! When a function calls itself, we call it recursion.&#xA;Using recursion often allows us to solve complex problems elegantlyâ€”with only a few lines of code.</description>

      <title>Example: Reversing a String</title>
      <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/05-recursion/02-string-example/</link>

      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/05-recursion/02-string-example/</guid>
      <description>Suppose we must write a program that reads in a sequence of keyboard characters and prints them in reverse order. The user ends the sequence by typing an asterisk character *.&#xA;We could solve this problem using an array, but since we do not know how many characters might be entered before the *, we could not be sure the program would actually work. However, we can use a recursive function since its ability to save the input data is not limited by a predefined array size.</description>

      <title>Implementing Recursion</title>

      <description>1function REVERSE2() 2 read CHARACTER 3 if CHARACTER == `*` then 4 return 5 else 6 print CHARACTER 7 REVERSE2() 8 return 9 end if 10end function The REVERSE2 function in the previous quiz actually prints the characters entered by the user in the same order in which they are typed. Notice how this small variation in the instruction order significantly changed the outcome of the function. To get a better understanding of why this occurs, we will delve into the order of execution in a little more depth.</description>

      <title>Example: Factorials</title>
      <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/05-recursion/04-factorial-example/</link>

      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/05-recursion/04-factorial-example/</guid>
      <description>The most popular example of using recursion is calculating the factorial of a positive integer $N$. The factorial of a positive integer $N$ is just the product of all the integers from $1$ to $N$. For example, the factorial of $5$, written as $5!$, is calculated as $5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120$. The definition of the factorial function itself is recursive.&#xA;$$&#xD;\text{fact}(N) = N * \text{fact}(N - 1)&#xD;$$ The corresponding pseudocode is shown below.</description>

      <title>Tree Recursion</title>

      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/05-recursion/05-tree-recursion/</guid>
      <description>In the previous examples we saw recursive functions that call themselves one time within the code. This type of recursion is called linear recursion, where head and tail recursion are two specific types of linear recursion.&#xA;In this section we will investigate another type of recursion called tree recursion, which occurs when a function calls itself two or more times to solve a single problem. To illustrate tree recursion, we will use a simple recursive function MAX, which finds the maximum of $N$ elements in an array.</description>

      <title>Example: Fibonacci Numbers</title>

      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/05-recursion/06-fibonacci-example/</guid>
      <description>Next, we will look at calculating Fibonacci numbers using a tree recursive algorithm. Fibonacci numbers are given by the following recursive formula.&#xA;$$&#xD;f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}&#xD;$$ Notice that Fibonacci numbers are defined recursively, so they should be a perfect application of tree recursion! However, there are cases where recursive functions are too inefficient compared to an iterative version to be of practical use. This typically happens when the recursive solutions to a problem end up solving the same subproblems multiple times.</description>

      <description>There are some problems where an iterative solution is difficult to implement and is not always immediately intuitive, while a recursive solution is simple, concise and easy to understand. A classic example is the problem of the Tower of Hanoi.&#xA;The Tower of Hanoi is a game that lends itself to a recursive solution. Suppose we have three towers on which we can put discs. The three towers are indicated by a letter, A, B, or C.</description>

      <title>Converting Recursion to Iteration</title>
      <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/05-recursion/08-recusion-to-iteration/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/05-recursion/08-recusion-to-iteration/</guid>
      <description>Iteration and recursion have the same expressive power, which means that any problem that has a recursive solution also has an iterative solution and vice versa. There are also standard techniques that allow you to transform a recursive program into an equivalent iterative version. The simplest case is for tail recursion, where the recursive call is the last step in the function. There are two cases of tail recursion to consider when converting to an iterative version.</description>

      <title>Recursion Summary</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/05-recursion/09-summary/</guid>
      <description>In this module, we explored the use of recursion to write concise solutions for a variety of problems. Recursion allows us to call a function from within itself, using either head recursion, tail recursion or tree recursion to solve smaller instances of the original problem.&#xA;Recursion requires a base case, which tells our function when to stop calling itself and start returning values, and a recursive case to handle reducing the problemâ€™s size and calling the function again, sometimes multiple times.</description>
