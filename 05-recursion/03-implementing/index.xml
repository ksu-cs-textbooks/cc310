    <description>1function REVERSE2() 2 read CHARACTER 3 if CHARACTER == `*` then 4 return 5 else 6 print CHARACTER 7 REVERSE2() 8 return 9 end if 10end function The REVERSE2 function in the previous quiz actually prints the characters entered by the user in the same order in which they are typed. Notice how this small variation in the instruction order significantly changed the outcome of the function. To get a better understanding of why this occurs, we will delve into the order of execution in a little more depth.</description>
