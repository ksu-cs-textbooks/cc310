    <title>Introducing Recursion :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/05-recursion/01-recursion-intro/</link>
    <description>We are now used to using functions in our programs that allow us to decompose complex problems into smaller problems that are easier to solve. Now, we will look at a slight wrinkle in how we use functions. Instead of simply having functions call other functions, we now allow for the fact that a function can actually call itself! When a function calls itself, we call it recursion.&#xA;Using recursion often allows us to solve complex problems elegantlyâ€”with only a few lines of code.</description>
