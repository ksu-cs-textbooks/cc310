    <title>Example: Reversing a String :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc310/05-recursion/02-string-example/</link>
    <description>Suppose we must write a program that reads in a sequence of keyboard characters and prints them in reverse order. The user ends the sequence by typing an asterisk character *.&#xA;We could solve this problem using an array, but since we do not know how many characters might be entered before the *, we could not be sure the program would actually work. However, we can use a recursive function since its ability to save the input data is not limited by a predefined array size.</description>
