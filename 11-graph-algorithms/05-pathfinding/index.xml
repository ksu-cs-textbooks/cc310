    <description>YouTube Video An important application for these traversals is the ability to find a path between two nodes. This has many applications in railroad networks as well as electrical wiring. With some modifications to the traversals, we can determine if electricity can flow from a source to a target. We will modify depth first and breadth first traversals in similar ways.&#xA;Info There are three cases that can happen when we search for a path between nodes:</description>
