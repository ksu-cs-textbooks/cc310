<p>In this chapter, we learned how to search for values in an array using a linear search method. Then, we explored four different sorting algorithms, and compared them based on their time complexity. Finally, we learned how we can use a sorted array to perform a faster binary search and saw how we can increase our performance by sorting our array before searching in certain situations.</p>
<p>Searching and sorting are two of the most common operations performed in computer programs, and it is very important to have a deep understanding of how they work. Many times the performance of a program can be improved simply by using the correct searching and sorting algorithms to fit the program&rsquo;s needs, and understanding when you might run into a particularly bad worst-case input.</p>
<p>The project in this module will involve implementing several of these algorithms in the language of your choice. As we learn about more data structures, we&rsquo;ll revisit these algorithms again to discuss how they can be improved or adapted to take advantage of different structures.</p>
