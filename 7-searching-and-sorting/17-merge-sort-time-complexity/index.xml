    <title>Merge Sort Time Complexity :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc310/7-searching-and-sorting/17-merge-sort-time-complexity/</link>
    <description>Now that we’ve reviewed the pseudocode for the merge sort algorithm, let’s see if we can analyze the time it takes to complete. Analyzing a recursive algorithm requires quite a bit of math and understanding to do it properly, but we can get a pretty close answer using a bit of intuition about what it does.&#xA;For starters, let’s consider a diagram that shows all of the different recursive calls made by merge sort, as shown below.</description>
