    <title>Binary Search :: CC 310 Textbook</title>

    <description>Now that we’ve learned how to sort the data in our container, let’s go back and revisit the concept of searching once again. Does our approach change when we know the data has been sorted?&#xA;Our intuition tells us that it should. Recall that we discussed how much easier it would be to find a particular paper in a sorted filing cabinet rather than just searching through a random pile of papers on the floor.</description>
