<p>Let&rsquo;s go back and look at the performance of our sorting algorithms, now that we know how quickly binary search can find a particular value in an array. Let&rsquo;s add the function $\text{lg}(N)$ to our graph from earlier, shown below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-4c6fccd01c9dd6331451fb5959ae554c" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Graph 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.26.graph2.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-4c6fccd01c9dd6331451fb5959ae554c"><img alt="Graph 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.26.graph2.png"></a></p>
<p>As we can see, the function $\text{lg}(N)$ is even smaller than $N$. So performing a binary search is much faster than a linear search, which we already know runs in the order of $N$ time.</p>
<p>However, performing a single linear search is still faster than any of the sorting algorithms we&rsquo;ve reviewed. So when does it become advantageous to sort our data?</p>
<p>This is a difficult question to answer since it depends on many factors. However, a good rule of thumb is to remember that the larger the data set, or the more times we need to search for a value, the better off we are to sort the data before we search.</p>
<p>In the graph below, the topmost line colored in red shows the approximate running time of $10$ linear search operations, while the bottom line in black shows the running time of performing a merge sort before $10$ binary search operations.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-86aadbacc89ee89c817793d880dea357" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Graph 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.26.graph3.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-86aadbacc89ee89c817793d880dea357"><img alt="Graph 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/7/7.26.graph3.png"></a></p>
<p>As we can see, it is more efficient to perform a merge sort, which runs in $N * \text{lg}(N)$ time, then perform $10$ binary searches running in $\text{lg}(N)$ time, than it is to perform $10$ linear searches running in $N$ time. The savings become more pronounced as the size of the input gets larger, as indicated by the X axis on the graph.</p>
<p>In fact, this analysis suggests that it may only take as few as 7 searches to see this benefit, even on smaller data sets. So, if we are writing a program that needs to search for a specific value in an array more than about 7 times, it is probably a good idea to sort the array before doing our searches, at least from a performance standpoint.</p>

<p>So far we&rsquo;ve looked at sorting algorithms that run in $N * \text{lg}(N)$ time. However, what if we try to sort the data as we add it to the array? In a later course, we&rsquo;ll learn how we can use an advanced data structure known as a <em>heap</em> to create a sorted array in nearly linear time (with some important caveats, of course)!</p>
