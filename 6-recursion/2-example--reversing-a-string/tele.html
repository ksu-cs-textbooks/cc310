<p>Suppose we must write a program that reads in a sequence of keyboard characters and prints them in reverse order. The user ends the sequence by typing an asterisk character <code>*</code>.</p>
<p>We could solve this problem using an array, but since we do not know how many characters might be entered before the <code>*</code>, we could not be sure the program would actually work. However, we can use a recursive function since its ability to save the input data is not limited by a predefined array size.</p>
<p>Our solution would look something like this. We&rsquo;ve also numbered the lines to make the following discussion easier to understand.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span class="line"><span class="cl">function REVERSE()			    (1)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    read CHARACTER			    (2)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    if CHARACTER == `*` then	(3)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return			        (4)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    else				        (5)

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return			        (8)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end if 				        (9)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">end function				    (10)</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="base-case">Base Case</h2>
<p>The function first reads a single character from the keyboard and stores it in <code>CHARACTER</code>. Then, in line 3 it checks to see if the user typed the <code>*</code> character. If so, we simply return, knowing that we have reached the end of the input and need to start printing out the characters we&rsquo;ve read in reverse order. This is the <em>base case</em> for this recursive function.</p>
<h2 id="recursive-case">Recursive Case</h2>
<p>If the <code>CHARACTER</code> we read in was not an <code>*</code>, line 6 will recursively call <code>REVERSE</code> to continue reading characters. Once the function returns (meaning that we have gotten an <code>*</code> character and started the return process) the function prints the <code>CHARACTER</code> in line 7 and then returns itself.</p>
<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at what happens within the computer when we run <code>REVERSE</code>. Let&rsquo;s say the program user wants to enter the three characters from the keyboard: <code>n</code>, <code>o</code>, and <code>w</code> followed by the <code>*</code> character. The following figure illustrates the basic concept of what is going on in the computer.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-8e7f414368bae3e6c6ac13cd5eb9689a" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Reverse Head Recursive Activation Stack" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/6/6.2.reverse-head.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-8e7f414368bae3e6c6ac13cd5eb9689a"><img alt="Reverse Head Recursive Activation Stack" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc310/images/6/6.2.reverse-head.png"></a></p>
<p>The arrows in the figure represent the order of execution of the statements in the computer. Each time we execute the recursive call to <code>REVERSE</code> in line 6, we create a new instance of the function, which starts its execution back at the beginning of the function (line 2). Then, when the function executes <code>return</code>, control reverts back to the next statement to be executed (line 7) in the calling instance of the function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that each instance of the function has its own set of variables whose values are unique to that instance. When we read <code>n</code> into the <code>CHARACTER</code> variable in the first instance of <code>REVERSE</code> it is not affected by anything that happens in the second instance of <code>REVERSE</code>.  Therefore, reading the <code>o</code> into <code>CHARACTER</code> in the second instance of <code>REVERSE</code> does not affect the value of <code>CHARACTER</code> in the first instance of <code>REVERSE</code>.</p>
<p>During the execution of the first instance of <code>REVERSE</code>, the user enters the character <code>n</code> so the <code>if</code> condition is <code>false</code> and we execute the <code>else</code> part of the statement, which calls the <code>REVERSE</code> function. (Note that before we actually start the second instance of <code>REVERSE</code>, the operating system stores the statement where we will pick up execution once the called function returns.) When the second instance of <code>REVERSE</code> is started, a new copy of all variables is created as well to ensure we do not overwrite the values from the first instance.</p>
<p>The execution of the second instance of  <code>REVERSE</code> runs exactly like the first instance except that the user enters the character <code>o</code> instead of <code>n</code>. Again, the <code>else</code> part of the <code>if</code> statement is executed, which calls the <code>REVERSE</code> function. When the third instance of <code>REVERSE</code> is executed, the user now inputs <code>w</code>, which again causes a new instance of <code>REVERSE</code> to be called.</p>
<p>Finally, in the fourth instance of <code>REVERSE</code>, the user inputs the <code>*</code> character, which causes the <code>if</code> part of the statement to execute, which performs our <code>return</code> statement. Once the <code>return</code> from the base case of our recursive function is performed, it starts the process of ending all the instances of the <code>REVERSE</code> function and creating the solution. When instance 4 of the <code>REVERSE</code> function returns, execution starts at the <code>write</code> statement (line 7) of instance 3. Here the character <code>w</code> is printed, and the function returns to instance 2. The same process is carried out in instance 2, which prints the <code>o</code> character and returns. Likewise, instance 1 prints its character <code>n</code> and then returns. The screen should now show the full output of the original call to <code>REVERSE</code> , which is &ldquo;won&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Recursion has allowed us to create a very simple and elegant solution to the problem of reversing an arbitrary number of characters. While you can do this in a non-recursive way using loops, the solution is not that simple. If you don&rsquo;t believe us, just try it! (Yes, that is a challenge.)</p>
