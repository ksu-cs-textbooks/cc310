    <title>Example: Tower of Hanoi :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc310/6-recursion/7-example--tower-of-hanoi/</link>
    <description>There are some problems where an iterative solution is difficult to implement and is not always immediately intuitive, while a recursive solution is simple, concise and easy to understand. A classic example is the problem of the Tower of Hanoi.&#xA;The Tower of Hanoi is a game that lends itself to a recursive solution. Suppose we have three towers on which we can put discs. The three towers are indicated by a letter, A, B, or C.</description>
