    <title>Singly Linked Lists - Other Operations :: CC 310 Textbook</title>

    <description>isEmpty The list isEmpty operation is rather straightforward. We simply need to return the truth of whether head.next has a null pointer. Obviously, isEmpty runs in constant time.&#xA;function isEmpty() returns boolean return head == NULL (1) end functionpeek The peek operation is designed to return the data from the last node inserted into the list, which is the node pointed at by head. This is easy to do; however, we must ensure that we check to see if the list is empty in line 1 before we return the head.</description>
