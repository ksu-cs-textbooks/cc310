    <title>Singly Linked Lists - Removal :: CC 310 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc310/9-lists/6-singly-linked-lists---removal/</link>
    <description>The process of removing a node from a linked list is fairly straightforward. First, we find the node we want to remove from the list and then change the next pointer from the previous node in the list to the next node in the list. This effectively bypasses the node we want to remove. For instance, if we want to remove node “3” from the following list,&#xA;we simply change the next pointer in the “-2” node to point to node “18” instead of node “3”.</description>
