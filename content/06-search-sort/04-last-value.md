Our `find` algorithm above will find the first instance of `number` in the `array` and return the index of that instance. However, we might also be interested in finding the last instance of `number` in `array`. Looking at our original `find` algorithm, it should be easy to find the last value by simply searching the array in reverse order, as shown in the following figure.

We will use the same example as above, except we will start searching backwards from the end of the array. In Step 1, we see that `index` is initialized to 7 and we compare `array[7]` against `number`, which are not the same. Thus, we continue to Step 2, where we decrement `index` to 6. Here `array[6]` is still not equal to `number`, so we continue in the loop. Finally, in Step 3, we decrement `index` to 5. Now `array[5]` contains the number `3`, which is equal to our `number` and we return the current `index` value.

Luckily for us, we can change our `for` loop index to decrement from the end of the array (`size of array - 1`) to the beginning (`0`). Thus, by simply changing line 3 in our original function, we can create a new function that searches for the last instance of `number` in `array`. The new function is shown below.

{{< highlight lineNos="true" lineNoStart="1" type="py" >}}
function REVERSEFIND(NUMBER, ARRAY)
    loop INDEX from size of ARRAY â€“ 1 to 0 step -1
        if ARRAY[INDEX] == NUMBER
            return INDEX
        end if
    end for
    return -1
end function
{{< /highlight >}}

Obviously, the `for` loop in line 2 holds the key to searching our array in reverse order. We start at the end of the array by using the index `size of array - 1` and then decrement the value of `index` (via the `step -1` qualifier) each time through the loop until we reach 0. The remainder of the function works exactly like the `find` function.
