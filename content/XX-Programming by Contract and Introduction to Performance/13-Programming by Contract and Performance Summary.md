In this module, we covered two major topics that will help us understand the data structures and algorithms we'll learn in this course. First, we learned about the use of _preconditions_, _postconditions_, and _loop invariants_ to help describe the exact specifications of how methods and loops should operate in code. We'll use these as the basis of _unit tests_ in this course to help prove the _correctness_ of data structures and algorithms we are asked to develop throughout the course.

In addition, we were introduced to the concepts of _time complexity_, _space complexity_, and _code complexity_, three ways to measure the performance and usefulness of a computer program. We also learned that it may be difficult to find a perfect program that has very little time, space, and code complexity, so many times we'll have to consider a trade-off between programs that operate quickly, use less memory, and are easier to understand.

Which these tools, we're in a much better place to understand the specifics of the data structures and algorithms we'll encounter in this module. Next, we'll do a short project to explore how we can build programs based on a set of preconditions, postconditions, and invariants instead of the plain language descriptions we've used up to this point.
