Many of the terms used in trees relate to terms used in family trees. Having this in mind can help us to better understand some of the terminology involved with abstract trees. Here we have a sample family tree. 
![Family Tree](images/14/3Tree_FamilyTree.png)

- `Ancestor` - The ancestors of a node are those reached from child to parent relationships. We can think of this as our parents and our parent's parents, and so on. 
    - Let's look at all of the ancestors of each of our nodes in the family tree.
        - Ava's ancestors: <u>Uzzi, Joe, Myra</u>. This is because, **Uzzi** is the parent of Ava, **Joe** is the parent of Uzzi, and **Myra** is the parent of Joe. Try to work out the following and click the name to reveal the ancestors. 
        {{% expand title="Uma:" %}}<u>Zia, Myra</u> - **Zia** is the parent of Uma and **Myra** is the parent of Zia. {{% /expand %}}
        {{% expand title="Myra:" %}}<u>None</u> - Myra does not have a parent node.{{% /expand %}}
        {{% expand title="Raju:" %}} <u>Myra</u> - **Myra** is the parent of Raju.{{% /expand %}}
        {{% expand title="Bev:" %}} <u>Uzzi, Joe, Myra</u> - **Uzzi** is the parent of Bev, **Joe** is the parent of Uzzi, and **Myra** is the parent of Joe.{{% /expand %}}
- `Descendant` - The descendants of a node are those reached from parent to child relationships. We can think of this as our children and our children's children and so on. 
    - Let's look at all of the descendants of each of our nodes in the family tree. 
        - Ava's descendants: <u>None</u>. Ava has no child nodes and thus, no descendants. Try to work out the following and click the name to reveal the descendants. 
        {{% expand title="Uma:" %}}<u>Ang</u> - **Ang** is the child of Uma{{% /expand %}}
        {{% expand title="Myra:" %}}<u>Raju, Joe, Zia, Uzzi, Bert, Uma, Bev, Ava, Ang, Isla, Eoin</u> - All of the nodes in a tree will be descendants of the root. To work it out: **Raju, Joe** and **Zia** are the children of Myra, **Uma** is the child of Zia, **Ang** is the child of Uma, and we can work the rest out for Joe's children. {{% /expand %}}
        {{% expand title="Raju:" %}}<u>None</u> - Raju has no child nodes.{{% /expand %}}
        {{% expand title="Bev:" %}}<u>Isla, Eoin</u> - **Isla** is the child of Bev and **Eoin** is the child of Isla.{{% /expand %}}
- `Siblings` - Nodes which share the same parent 
    - We can think about the siblings of all of our nodes in the family tree. 
        - Ava's siblings: <u>Bev</u> - Uzzi is the parent node of Ava; Uzzi has two child nodes, Ava and **Bev**. Try to work out the following and click the name to reveal the siblings. 
        {{% expand title="Uma:" %}}<u>None</u> - Zia is the parent node of Uma; Zia has only one child node, Uma.{{% /expand %}}
        {{% expand title="Myra:" %}}<u>None</u> - Myra is the root and thus does not have a parent node resulting in no siblings.{{% /expand %}}
        {{% expand title="Raju:" %}}<u>Joe, Zia</u> -  Myra is the parent node of Raju; Myra has three child nodes, **Joe**, **Zia**, and Raju{{% /expand %}}
        {{% expand title="Bev:" %}}<u>Ava</u> - Uzzi is the parent node of Bev; Uzzi has two child nodes, Bev and **Ava**.{{% /expand %}}
