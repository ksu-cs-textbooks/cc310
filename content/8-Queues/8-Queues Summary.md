In this module we looked at the queue data structure. Queues are a "first in first out" data structure that use two main operations, enqueue and dequeue, to put data into the queue and to remove data from the queue. Queues are useful in many applications including the scheduling of tasks, sharing of resources, and processing of messages in the proper order.
