In this chapter, we introduced a number of different _data structures_ that we can use in our programs. In addition, we explored several _algorithmic techniques_ we can use to develop algorithms that manipulate these data structures to allow us to solve complex problems in our code.

Throughout the rest of this course, as well as a subsequent course, we'll explore many of these data structures and techniques in detail. We hope that introducing them all at the same time here will allow us to compare and contrast each one as we learn more about it, while still keeping in mind that there are many different structures and techniques that will be available to us in the future.
