The other major topic covered in this course is the use of _algorithms_ to manipulate the data stored in our data structures. 

An _algorithm_ is best defined as a finite list of specific instructions for performing a task. In the real world, we see algorithms all the time. A recipe for cooking your favorite dish, instructions for how to fix a broken car, or a method for solving a complex mathematical equation can all be considered examples of an algorithm. The flowchart above shows [Euclid's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. 

In this course, however, we're going to look specifically at the algorithms and algorithmic techniques that are most commonly used with data structures in computer programming. 

## Algorithmic Techniques

An _algorithmic technique_, sometimes referred to as a _methodology_ or _paradigm_, is a particular way to design an algorithm. While there are a few commonly used algorithms across different data structures, many times each program may need a unique algorithm, or at least an adaptation of an existing algorithm. to perform its work.

To make these numerous algorithms easier to understand, we can loosely categorize them based on the techniques they use to solve the problem. On the next few pages, we'll introduce some of the more commonly used algorithmic techniques in this course. Throughout this course, we will learn how to apply many of these techniques when designing algorithms that work with various data structures to accomplish a goal.
