Retrieved 03:05, February 8, 2020 from https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Directed_acyclic_graph_2.svg&amp;oldid=195167720.]&#xA;The most general version of a non-linear data structure is the graph, as shown in the diagram above. A graph is a set of nodes that contain data, as well as a set of edges that link two nodes together. Edges themselves may also contain data.&#xA;Graphs are great for storing and visualizing not just data, but also the relationships between data.</description>
