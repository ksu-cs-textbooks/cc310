    <description>Another linear data structure is known as a set. A set is very similar to a list, but with two major differences:&#xA;A set cannot contain duplicate elements. Each element must be unique in the set. A set does not necessarily keep track of the ordering of the elements within the set. In fact, the term set comes from mathematics. Weâ€™ve probably seen sets already in a math class.</description>
